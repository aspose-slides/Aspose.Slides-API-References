## IChartSeries::get_BubbleSizeScale() method


Specifies the scale factor for the bubble chart (can be between 0 and 300 percents of the default size). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_BubbleSizeScale() read/write property for change value.

```cpp
virtual int32_t Aspose::Slides::Charts::IChartSeries::get_BubbleSizeScale()=0
```

## Remarks


This is the projection of the property [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_BubbleSizeScale().
