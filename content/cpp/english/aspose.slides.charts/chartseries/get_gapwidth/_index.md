This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_GapWidth() read/write property for change value. Read-only **int32_t**.

int32_t Aspose::Slides::Charts::ChartSeries::get_GapWidth() override
```
