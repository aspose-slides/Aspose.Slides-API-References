## ChartSeries::get_FirstSliceAngle() method


Specifies the angle of the first pie or doughnut chart slice, in degrees (clockwise from up, from 0 to 360 degrees). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_FirstSliceAngle() read/write property for change value. Read-only **uint16_t**.

```cpp
uint16_t Aspose::Slides::Charts::ChartSeries::get_FirstSliceAngle() override
```

## Remarks


This is the projection of the property [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_FirstSliceAngle().
