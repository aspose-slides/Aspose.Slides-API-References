| [Details_ExternalException](./details_externalexception/) | The base exception type for all COM interop exceptions and structured exception handling (SEH) exceptions. Never create instances of this class manually. Use the ExternalException class instead. Never wrap the ExternalException class instances into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/). |
| [Marshal](./marshal/) | Provides marshalling implementation. For compatibility with translated code only, as no managed code is supported on C++ side. This is a static type with no instance services. You should never create instances of it by any means. |
## Structures

| [FILETIME](./filetime/) | Holds file time components. This type should be allocated on stack and passed to functions by value or by reference. Never use [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) class to manage objects of this type. |
## Enums
