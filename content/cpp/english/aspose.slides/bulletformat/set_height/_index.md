## BulletFormat::set_Height(float) method


Sets the bullet height of a paragraph with no inheritance. Value std::numeric_limits<float>::quiet_NaN() determines that bullet inherits height from the first portion in the paragraph. Write **float**.

```cpp
void Aspose::Slides::BulletFormat::set_Height(float value) override
```

## Remarks


A negative height value means that the height is given in points and a positive value means the height is a percentage of the surrounding text.
