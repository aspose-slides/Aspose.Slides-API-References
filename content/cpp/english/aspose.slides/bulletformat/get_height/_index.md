## BulletFormat::get_Height() method


Returns the bullet height of a paragraph with no inheritance. Value std::numeric_limits<float>::quiet_NaN() determines that bullet inherits height from the first portion in the paragraph. Read **float**.

float Aspose::Slides::BulletFormat::get_Height() override
```

## Remarks


A negative height value means that the height is given in points and a positive value means the height is a percentage of the surrounding text.
