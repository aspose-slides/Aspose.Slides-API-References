## IShape::get_Y() method


Gets the y-coordinate of the shape's upper-left corner, measured in points. Read **float**.

```cpp
virtual float Aspose::Slides::IShape::get_Y()=0
```

## Remarks


The value returned is always defined and never [std::numeric_limits<float>::quiet_NaN()](../). The value assigned must also be defined; assign [std::numeric_limits<float>::quiet_NaN()](../) only to properties of a **RawFrame** instance.
