## Shape::set_X(float) method


Sets the x-coordinate of the shape's upper-left corner, measured in points. Write **float**.

```cpp
void Aspose::Slides::Shape::set_X(float value) override
```

## Remarks


The value returned is always defined and never [std::numeric_limits<float>::quiet_NaN()](../). The value assigned must also be defined; assign [std::numeric_limits<float>::quiet_NaN()](../) only to properties of a **RawFrame** instance.
