## TimerQueue class


Queue that handles [Timer](../timer/) objects. This is just an implementation. [Timer](../timer/) objects register there by themselves, you don't have to do so to use them - use [Timer](../timer/) class API instead. This is a singleton type with memory management done by access function(s). You should never create instances of it directly.

```cpp
class TimerQueue
```

| static [TimerQueue](./)\& [GetInstance](./getinstance/)() | Implementation singleton. |
| static void [JoinWorkerThread](./joinworkerthread/)() | Joins worker thread. Waits infinitely if required. |
| void [operator=](./operator_equal/)(const [TimerQueue](./)\&) | No copying. |
