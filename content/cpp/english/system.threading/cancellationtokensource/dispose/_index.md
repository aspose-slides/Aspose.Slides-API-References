## CancellationTokenSource::Dispose() method


Releases all resources used by the [CancellationTokenSource](../).

```cpp
void System::Threading::CancellationTokenSource::Dispose() override
```

## Remarks


Unregisters all callbacks and makes the token unusable. 
Multiple calls are safe and have no additional effect.
