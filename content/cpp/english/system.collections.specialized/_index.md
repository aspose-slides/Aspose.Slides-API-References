## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BitVector32](./bitvector32/) | Provides a simple light bit vector with easy integer or [Boolean](../system/boolean/) access to a 32 bit storage. |
| [NameValueCollection](./namevaluecollection/) | Collection of associated [String](../system/string/) keys and [String](../system/string/) values that can be accessed either with the key or with the index. |
| [StringCollection](./stringcollection/) | Indexed list of strings. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
| [StringCollectionPtr](./stringcollectionptr/) | Stirng collection poiner with access operator. |
| [StringDictionary](./stringdictionary/) | [String](../system/string/) to string dictionary. Objects of this class should only be allocated using [System::MakeObject()](../system/makeobject/) function. Never create instance of this type on stack or using operator new, as it will result in runtime errors and/or assertion faults. Always wrap this class into [System::SmartPtr](../system/smartptr/) pointer and use this pointer to pass it to functions as argument. |
## Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **bool** [operator==](./operator_equal_equal/)(**BitVector32::Section**, **BitVector32::Section**) | Checks if two specified objects are equal. |
| **bool** [operator!=](./operator_not_equal/)(**BitVector32::Section**, **BitVector32::Section**) | Checks if two specified objects are not equal. |
