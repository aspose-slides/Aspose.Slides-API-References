## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [getAnchorPoint](getanchorpoint)() | Returns or sets a point in 3D space. This point is the point in space that anchors the backdrop plane. 3D point represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [getNormalVector](getnormalvector)() | Returns or sets a normal vector. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector normal to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [getUpVector](getupvector)() | Returns or sets a vector representing up. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector representing up in relation to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [getVersion](getversion)() |  |
| [setAnchorPoint](setanchorpoint)(float[]) | Returns or sets a point in 3D space. This point is the point in space that anchors the backdrop plane. 3D point represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [setNormalVector](setnormalvector)(float[]) | Returns or sets a normal vector. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector normal to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [setUpVector](setupvector)(float[]) | Returns or sets a vector representing up. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector representing up in relation to the face of the backdrop plane.
