## PortionFormat class

 This class contains the text portion formatting properties. Unlike  IPortionFormatEffectiveData, all properties of this class are writeable.
 This class is used to return and manipulate text portion formatting properties defined for the particular portion. This means that
 no inheritance is applied when getting values so for the majority of cases you will get values meaning "undefined".
 In order to get the effective formatting parameter values including inherited you need to use  PortionFormat#getEffective method 
 which returns a  IPortionFormatEffectiveData instance.
| [PortionFormat]() | Initializes a new instance of PortionFormat class. |
