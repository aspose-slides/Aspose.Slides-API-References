## MathSpacingRules class

 Types of gap (horizontal spacing) between columns of a matrix
 

## Constants

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
[SingleSpacingGap](#SingleSpacingGap) | 0 | Single (1 em for columns or 1 line for rows) |
[OneAndHalfSpacingGap](#OneAndHalfSpacingGap) | 1 | One and a half (1.5 ems for columns or 1.5 lines for rows) |
[DoubleSpacingGap](#DoubleSpacingGap) | 2 | Double spacing (2 ems for columns or 2 lines for rows) |
[Exactly](#Exactly) | 3 | Exactly value For columns, rely on value of ColumnGap, measured in twips For rows, rely on value of RowGap, measured in twips |
[Multiple](#Multiple) | 4 | Multiple For columns, rely on value of ColumnGap, measured in 0.5 em increments For rows, rely on value of RowGap, measured in lines |
