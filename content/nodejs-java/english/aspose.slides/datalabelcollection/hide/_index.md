## hide()  function

 Make data label hidden by default by setting all Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) of the 
 DefaultDataLabelFormat property to false state.
 IsVisible will be false after this.
 
 If data label is not visible by default (IsVisible is false) you can make data label "visible 
 by default" with setting Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) of the DefaultDataLabelFormat property
 to true state.
