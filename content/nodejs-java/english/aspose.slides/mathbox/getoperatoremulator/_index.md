## getOperatorEmulator()  function

 Operator Emulator.
 When true, the box and its contents behave as a single operator and inherit the properties of an operator. 
 This means, for example, that the character can serve as a point for a line break and can be aligned to other operators.
 Operator Emulators are often used when one or more glyphs combine to form an operator, such as '=='.
 Default value: false
 

### Result
boolean
