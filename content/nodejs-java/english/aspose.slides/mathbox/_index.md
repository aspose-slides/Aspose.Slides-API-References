## MathBox class

 Specifies the logical boxing (packaging) of mathematical element.
 For example, a boxed object can serve as an operator emulator with or without an alignment point, 
 serve as a line break point, or be grouped such as not to allow line breaks within.
 For example, the "==" operator should be boxed to prevent line breaks.

Operator Emulators are often used when one or more glyphs combine to form an operator, such as '=='. Default value: false |

 **Returns:**
boolean


---

---


### setDifferential {#setDifferential}

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| setDifferential (boolean) | Differential When true, the box acts as a differential (e.g., ?? in an integrand), and receives the appropriate horizontal spacing for the mathematical differential. Default: false |


---


### setExplicitBreak {#setExplicitBreak}

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| setExplicitBreak (byte) | Explicit break specifies whether there is a line break at the start of the Box object, such that the line wraps at the start of the box object. Specifies the number of the operator on the previous line of mathematical text which shall be used as the alignment point for the current line of mathematical text possible values: 1..255 Default: 0 (no explicit break) |
