## setPresentationLockingBehavior(int value)  function

 This property defines if an instance of the Presentation class can be an owner of the source - file 
 or stream during the instance lifetime. If the instance is an owner, it locks the source. This helps 
 to improve memory consumption and performance while working with BLOBs, but the source (stream or file) 
 can't be changed during Presentation's instance lifetime.
