## MathBox.OperatorEmulator property

Operator Emulator. When true, the box and its contents behave as a single operator and inherit the properties of an operator. This means, for example, that the character can serve as a point for a line break and can be aligned to other operators. Operator Emulators are often used when one or more glyphs combine to form an operator, such as '=='. Default value: false

```csharp
public bool OperatorEmulator { get; set; }
```

### Examples

Example:

```csharp
[C#]
MathBox box = new MathBox(new MathematicalText("=="));
box.OperatorEmulator = true;
```
