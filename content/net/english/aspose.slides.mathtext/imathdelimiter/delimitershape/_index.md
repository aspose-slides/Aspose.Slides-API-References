## IMathDelimiter.DelimiterShape property

Specifies the shape of delimiters in the delimiter object. When is MathDelimiterShape.Centered, delimiters are centered around the math axis of the mathematical text and still be made to fit the entire height of their contents. When is MathDelimiterShape.Match, their height and shape are altered to exactly match their contents.

```csharp
public MathDelimiterShape DelimiterShape { get; set; }
```

### Examples

Example:

```csharp
[C#]
IMathDelimiter delimiter = new MathematicalText("x").Divide("y").Enclose();
delimiter.DelimiterShape = MathDelimiterShape.Match;
```
