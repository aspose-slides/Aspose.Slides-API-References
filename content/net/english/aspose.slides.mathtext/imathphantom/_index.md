## IMathPhantom interface

Represents a phantom math object (&lt;m:phant&gt;) that affects the layout of its child element without necessarily displaying it. A phantom can hide its base expression while preserving its width, height, or depth to align formulas or reserve space. Visibility and geometry behavior are controlled by properties such as Show, ZeroWid, ZeroAsc, ZeroDesc, and Transp.

```csharp
public interface IMathPhantom : IMathElement
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Base](../../aspose.slides.mathtext/imathphantom/base) { get; } | Base argument |
| [Show](../../aspose.slides.mathtext/imathphantom/show) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating whether the base element is displayed. |
| [Transp](../../aspose.slides.mathtext/imathphantom/transp) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating whether the phantom is transparent for class-based spacing rules. |
| [ZeroAsc](../../aspose.slides.mathtext/imathphantom/zeroasc) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating whether the ascent (height above baseline) of the base element should be treated as zero. |
| [ZeroDesc](../../aspose.slides.mathtext/imathphantom/zerodesc) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating whether the descent (depth below baseline) of the base element should be treated as zero. |
| [ZeroWidth](../../aspose.slides.mathtext/imathphantom/zerowidth) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating whether the width of the base element should be treated as zero. |

### Examples

Example:

```csharp
[C#]
IMathPhantom phantom = new MathPhantom(new MathematicalText("1/2"));
phantom.Show = false;          // Hide the content
phantom.ZeroWidth = false;     // Keep the width
```
