## MathMatrix.ColumnGap property

The value of horizontal spacing between columns of a matrix; If the ColumnGapRule is set to 3 ("Exactly"), then the unit is interpreted as twips (1/20th of a point) If the ColumnGapRule is set to 4 ("Multiple"), then the unit is interpreted as number of 0.5 em increments. In other cases ignored. Default: 0

```csharp
public uint ColumnGap { get; set; }
```

### Examples

Example:

```csharp
[C#]
IMathMatrix matrix = new MathMatrix(2, 3);
matrix.ColumnGapRule = MathSpacingRules.Exactly;
matrix.ColumnGap = 20;
```
