## Ink.InkEffectImages property

Gets the collection of custom images used to simulate visual effects for ink brushes. These images are used when rendering ink with specific [`InkEffectType`](../../inkeffecttype) values, such as Galaxy, Rainbow, etc. By providing your own images, you can control how each ink effect appears.

```csharp
public static IDictionary<InkEffectType, IImage> InkEffectImages { get; }
```

### Remarks

This property allows replacing the default ink effect textures with user-defined ones, which is particularly useful when default assets are restricted by licensing or unavailable at runtime. Each entry in the dictionary must associate an [`InkEffectType`](../../inkeffecttype) value with a corresponding [`IImage`](../../../aspose.slides/iimage) object (e.g., Bitmap, or an Aspose image interface).

### Examples

```csharp
[C#]
IImage image = Images.FromFile("image.png");
Ink.InkEffectImages.Add(InkEffectType.Galaxy, image);
```
