## MotionEffect class

Represent motion effect behavior of effect.

```csharp
public class MotionEffect : Behavior, IMotionEffect
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [MotionEffect](motioneffect)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Accumulate](../../aspose.slides.animation/behavior/accumulate) { get; set; } | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated. Read/write [`NullableBool`](../../aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [Additive](../../aspose.slides.animation/behavior/additive) { get; set; } | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations. Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](../behavioradditivetype). |
| [Angle](../../aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/angle) { get; set; } | Describes the relative angle of the motion path. Read/write Single. |
| [By](../../aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/by) { get; set; } | Describes the relative offset value for the animation (in percents). Read/write PointF. |
| [From](../../aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/from) { get; set; } | Specifies an x/y co-ordinate to start the animation from (in percents). Read/write PointF. |
| [Origin](../../aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/origin) { get; set; } | Specifies what the origin of the motion path is relative to such as the layout of the slide, or the parent. Read/write [`MotionOriginType`](../motionorigintype). |
| [Path](../../aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/path) { get; set; } | Specifies the path primitive followed by coordinates for the animation motion. Read/write [`IMotionPath`](../imotionpath). |
| [PathEditMode](../../aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/patheditmode) { get; set; } | Specifies how the motion path moves when shape is moved. Read/write [`MotionPathEditMode`](../motionpatheditmode). |
| [Properties](../../aspose.slides.animation/behavior/properties) { get; } | Represents properties of behavior. Read-only [`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](../ibehaviorpropertycollection). |
| [RotationCenter](../../aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/rotationcenter) { get; set; } | Describes the center of the rotation used to rotate a motion path by X angle. Read/write PointF. |
| [Timing](../../aspose.slides.animation/behavior/timing) { get; set; } | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior. Read/write [`ITiming`](../itiming). |
| [To](../../aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/to) { get; set; } | Specifies the target location for an animation motion effect (in percents). Read/write PointF. |
