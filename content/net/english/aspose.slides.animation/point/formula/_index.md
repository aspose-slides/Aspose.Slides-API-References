## Point.Formula property

Formulas within values, from, to, by attributes can be made up of these: Standard arithmetic operators: ‘+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘^’, ‘%’ (mod) Constants: ‘pi’ ‘e’ Conditional operators: ‘abs’, ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘?’ (if) Comparison operators: '==', '&gt;=', '', '!=', '!' Trigonometric operators: ‘sin()’, ‘cos()’, ‘tan()’, ‘asin()’, ‘acos()’, ‘atan()’ Natural logarithm ‘ln()’ Property references (host supported properties) for example: "#ppt_x+(cos(-2*pi*(1-$))*-#ppt_x-sin(-2*pi*(1-$))*(1-#ppt_y))*(1-$)" Read/write String.

```csharp
public string Formula { get; set; }
```
