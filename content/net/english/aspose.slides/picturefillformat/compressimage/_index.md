## CompressImage(bool, PicturesCompression) {#compressimage}

Compresses the image by reducing its size based on the shape size and specified resolution. Optionally, it also deletes cropped areas.

```csharp
public bool CompressImage(bool deleteCroppedAreasOfImage, PicturesCompression resolution)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| deleteCroppedAreasOfImage | Boolean | If true, the method will remove the cropped areas of the image, potentially further reducing its size. |
| resolution | PicturesCompression | The target resolution for compression, specified as a value of the [`PicturesCompression`](../../../aspose.slides.export/picturescompression) enum. |

### Return Value

A Boolean indicating whether the image was successfully compressed. Returns `true` if the image was resized or cropped, otherwise `false`.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentException | Thrown when the resolution is not a valid value. |

### Remarks

This method changes the image's size and resolution similar to PowerPoint's "Picture Format -&gt; Compress Pictures" feature.

### Examples

The following example demonstrates how to use the `CompressImage` method to reduce the size of an image in a presentation by setting a target resolution and removing cropped areas:

```csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("demo.pptx"))
{
    ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
    IPictureFrame picFrame = slide.Shapes[0] as IPictureFrame;
    // Compress the image with a target resolution of 150 DPI (Web resolution) and remove cropped areas
    bool result = picFrame.PictureFormat.CompressImage(true, PicturesCompression.Dpi150);
}
```

## CompressImage(bool, float) {#compressimage_1}

Compresses the image by reducing its size based on the shape size and specified resolution. Optionally, it also deletes cropped areas.

```csharp
public bool CompressImage(bool deleteCroppedAreasOfImage, float resolution)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| deleteCroppedAreasOfImage | Boolean | If true, the method will remove the cropped areas of the image, potentially further reducing its size. |
| resolution | Single | The target resolution in DPI. This value must be positive and defines how the image will be resized. |

### Return Value

A Boolean indicating whether the image was successfully compressed. Returns `true` if the image was resized or cropped, otherwise `false`.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentException | Thrown when the resolution is not a positive value. |

### Remarks

This method changes the image's size and resolution similar to PowerPoint's "Picture Format -&gt; Compress Pictures" feature.

### Examples

The following example demonstrates how to use the `CompressImage` method to reduce the size of an image in a presentation by setting a target resolution and removing cropped areas:

```csharp
[C#]
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("demo.pptx"))
{
    ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];

    // Gets the PictureFrame
    IPictureFrame picFrame = slide.Shapes[0] as IPictureFrame;

    // Compress the image with a target resolution of 150 DPI (Web resolution) and remove cropped areas
    bool result=picFrame.PictureFormat.CompressImage(true, 150f); // Web resolution
}
```
