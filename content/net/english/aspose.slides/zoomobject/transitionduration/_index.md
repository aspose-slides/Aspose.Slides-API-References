## ZoomObject.TransitionDuration property

Gets or sets the duration of the transition between Zoom and slide. Read/write Single. Default value: 1.0f

```csharp
public float TransitionDuration { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

If not specified (TransitionDur = 0), it will use the destination slide transition and the timings associated with that transition.

### Examples

the example demonstrates changing the duration of the transition between Zoom and slide:

```csharp
[C#]
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    IZoomFrame zoomFrame = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddZoomFrame(150, 20, 50, 50, pres.Slides[1]);
    zoomFrame.TransitionDuration = 2.5f;
}
```
