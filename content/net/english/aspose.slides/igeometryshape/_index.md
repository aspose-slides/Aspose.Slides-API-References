## IGeometryShape interface

Represents the parent class for all geometric shapes.

```csharp
public interface IGeometryShape : IShape
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Adjustments](../../aspose.slides/igeometryshape/adjustments) { get; } | Returns a collection of shape's adjustment values. Read-only [`IAdjustValueCollection`](../iadjustvaluecollection). |
| [AsIShape](../../aspose.slides/igeometryshape/asishape) { get; } | Allows to get base IShape interface. Read-only [`IShape`](../ishape). |
| [ShapeStyle](../../aspose.slides/igeometryshape/shapestyle) { get; } | Returns shape's style object. Read-only [`IShapeStyle`](../ishapestyle). |
| [ShapeType](../../aspose.slides/igeometryshape/shapetype) { get; set; } | Returns or sets the geometry preset type. Note: on value changing all adjustment values will reset to their default values. Read/write [`ShapeType`](../shapetype). |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CreateShapeElements](../../aspose.slides/igeometryshape/createshapeelements)() | Creates and returns array of shape's elements. |
| [GetGeometryPaths](../../aspose.slides/igeometryshape/getgeometrypaths)() | Returns the copy of path of the geometry shape. Coordinates are relative to the left top corner of the shape. |
| [SetGeometryPath](../../aspose.slides/igeometryshape/setgeometrypath)(IGeometryPath) | Updates shape geometry from [`IGeometryPath`](../igeometrypath) object. Coordinates must be relative to the left top corner of the shape. Changes the type of the shape ([`ShapeType`](./shapetype)) to Custom. |
| [SetGeometryPaths](../../aspose.slides/igeometryshape/setgeometrypaths)(IGeometryPath[]) | Updates shape geometry from array of [`IGeometryPath`](../igeometrypath). Coordinates must be relative to the left top corner of the shape. Changes the type of the shape ([`ShapeType`](./shapetype)) to Custom. |
