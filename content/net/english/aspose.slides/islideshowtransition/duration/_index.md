## ISlideShowTransition.Duration property

Gets or sets the duration of the slide transition effect in milliseconds. Read/write Int32.

```csharp
public int Duration { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Corresponds to the `p14:dur` attribute of the `p:transition` element in the PresentationML schema. If not set, the duration is determined automatically based on the [`Speed`](../speed) property and the transition type.
