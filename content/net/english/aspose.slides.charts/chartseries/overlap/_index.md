## ChartSeries.Overlap property

Specifies how much bars and columns overlap on 2-D charts, as a percentage (from -100% to 100%). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group. It is a projection of the appropriate property in the parent series group, and so this property is read-only. To change the value, use the !:ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap read/write property. Read-only SByte.

```csharp
public sbyte Overlap { get; }
```

### Remarks

Overlap specifies the degree of overlap or spacing between bars and columns as a percentage of their width: - -100%: Maximum spacing (bars are completely separated). - 0%: Bars are placed side by side without overlap or spacing. - 100%: Maximum overlap (bars completely overlap each other). This is a projection of the property !:ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap.
