## second_pie_size property
Specifies the size of the second pie or bar of a pie-of-pie chart or 
            a bar-of-pie chart, as a percentage of the size of the first pie (can 
            be between 5 and 200 percents).
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.SecondPieSize read/write property for change value.
            Read-only **int**.


### Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.SecondPieSize.
