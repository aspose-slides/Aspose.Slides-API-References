## gap_width property
Specifies the space between bar or column clusters, as a percentage of the bar or column width.
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.GapWidth read/write property for change value.
            Read-only **int**.


### Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.GapWidth.
