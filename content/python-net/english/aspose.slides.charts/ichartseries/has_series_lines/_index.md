## has_series_lines property
Determines whether there are series lines for this series and kindred series.
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.HasSeriesLines read/write property for change value.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.SeriesLinesFormat property for format series lines.
            Read-only **bool**.
