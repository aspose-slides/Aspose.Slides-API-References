## overlap property
Specifies how much bars and columns overlap on 2-D charts, as a percentage (from -100% to 100%). 
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group. 
            It is a projection of the appropriate property in the parent series group, and so this property is read-only.
            To change the value, use the ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap read/write property.
            Read-only **int**.


### Remarks

Overlap specifies the degree of overlap or spacing between bars and columns as a percentage of their width:
            - -100%: Maximum spacing (bars are completely separated).
            - 0%: Bars are placed side by side without overlap or spacing.
            - 100%: Maximum overlap (bars completely overlap each other).
            This is a projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap.

### Definition:
