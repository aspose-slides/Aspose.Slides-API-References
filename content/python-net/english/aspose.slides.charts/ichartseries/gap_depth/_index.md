## gap_depth property
Returns or sets the distance, as a percentage of the marker width, between the data series in a 3D chart.
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.GapDepth read/write property for change value.
            Read-only **int**.


### Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.GapDepth.
