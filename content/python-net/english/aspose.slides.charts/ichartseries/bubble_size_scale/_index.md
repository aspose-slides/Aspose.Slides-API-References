## bubble_size_scale property
Specifies the scale factor for the bubble chart (can be 
            between 0 and 300 percents of the default size).
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.BubbleSizeScale read/write property for change value.


### Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.BubbleSizeScale.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def bubble_size_scale(self):
    ...
```
