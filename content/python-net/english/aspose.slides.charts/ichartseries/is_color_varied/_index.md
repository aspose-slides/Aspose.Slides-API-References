## is_color_varied property
Specifies that each data marker in the series has a different color.
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.IsColorVaried read/write property for change value.
            Read-only .NET type System.Boolean.


### Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.IsColorVaried.
