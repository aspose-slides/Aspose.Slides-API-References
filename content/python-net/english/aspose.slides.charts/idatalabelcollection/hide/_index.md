## hide {#}
Make data label hidden by default by setting all Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) of the 
            DefaultDataLabelFormat property to false state.
            IsVisible will be false after this.


```python
def hide(self):
    ...
```


### Remarks

If data label is not visible by default (IsVisible is false) you can make data label "visible 
            by default" with setting Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) of the DefaultDataLabelFormat property
            to true state.
