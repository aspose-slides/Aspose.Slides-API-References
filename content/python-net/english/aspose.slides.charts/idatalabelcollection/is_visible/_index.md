## is_visible property
False means that data label is not visible by default (and so all 
            Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) of the DefaultDataLabelFormat property are false).
            Read-only **bool**.


### Remarks

If data label is visible by default you can make it hidden by default with Hide() method.
            But if data label is not visible by default (IsVisible is false) you can make data label "visible 
            by default" with setting Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) of the DefaultDataLabelFormat property
            to true state.

### Definition:
