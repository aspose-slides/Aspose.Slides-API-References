## rotation_x property
Returns or sets the rotation degree around the X-axis, i.e. in the Y direction for 3D charts (between -90 and 90 degrees).
            The property matches with the 21.2.2.157 rotX (X Rotation) item in ECMA-376 and with the "Y Rotation" option in PowerPoint 2007+.
            Read/write **int**.
