## right_angle_axes property
Determines whether the chart axes are at right angles, rather than drawn in perspective.
            In other words it determines whether the chart angles of axes are independent from chart 
            rotation or elevation.
            Read/write **bool**.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def right_angle_axes(self):
    ...
@right_angle_axes.setter
def right_angle_axes(self, value):
    ...
```
