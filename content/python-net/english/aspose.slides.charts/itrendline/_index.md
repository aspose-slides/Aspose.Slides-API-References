## ITrendline class

Class represents trend line of chart series

The ITrendline type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`trendline_name`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/trendline_name/) | Gets or sets  name of the trendline.<br/>            Read/write **str**. |
| [`trendline_type`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/trendline_type/) | Gets or sets type of trend line. <br/>            Read/write [`ITrendline.trendline_type`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/trendline_type). |
| [`format`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/format/) | Represents the format of the trend line.<br/>            Read/write [`IFormat`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/iformat). |
| [`backward`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/backward/) | Specifies the number of categories (or units on a scatter chart) that the trend line extends before<br/>            the data for the series that is being trended. On scatter and non-scatter charts, the value shall be any nonnegative<br/>            value.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`forward`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/forward/) | Specifies the number of categories (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends after the<br/>            data for the series that is being trended. On scatter and non-scatter charts, the value shall be any non-negative<br/>            value.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`intercept`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/intercept/) | Specifies the value where the trendline shall cross the y axis. This property shall be supported only<br/>            when the trendline type is exp, linear, or poly.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`display_equation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/display_equation/) | Specifies that the equation for the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same label as the Rsquaredvalue).<br/>            Read/write **bool**. |
| [`order`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/order/) | Specifies the order of the polynomial trend line. It is ignored for other trend line types. Value must be between 2 and 6.<br/>            Read/write **int**. |
| [`period`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/period/) | Specifies the period of the trend line for a moving average trend line. It is ignored for other trend<br/>            line variants. Value must be between 2 and 255.<br/>            Read/write **int**. |
| [`display_r_squared_value`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/display_r_squared_value/) | Specifies that the R-squared value of the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same label as the equation).<br/>            Read/write **bool**. |
| [`related_legend_entry`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/related_legend_entry/) | Represents legend entry related with this trendline<br/>            Read-only [`ILegendEntryProperties`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/ilegendentryproperties). |
| [`text_frame_for_overriding`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/text_frame_for_overriding/) |  |
| [`text_format`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/text_format/) |  |
| [`chart`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/chart/) |  |
| [`slide`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/slide/) |  |
| [`presentation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/itrendline/presentation/) |  |
