## ITrendline class

Class represents trend line of chart series

The ITrendline type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [trendline_name](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/trendline_name) | Gets or sets  name of the trendline.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`System.String`. |
| [trendline_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/trendline_type) | Gets or sets type of trend line. <br/>            Read/write :py:attr:`aspose.slides.charts.ITrendline.trendline_type`. |
| [format](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/format) | Represents the format of the trend line.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.charts.IFormat`. |
| [backward](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/backward) | Specifies the number of categories (or units on a scatter chart) that the trend line extends before<br/>            the data for the series that is being trended. On scatter and non-scatter charts, the value shall be any nonnegative<br/>            value.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [forward](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/forward) | Specifies the number of categories (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends after the<br/>            data for the series that is being trended. On scatter and non-scatter charts, the value shall be any non-negative<br/>            value.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [intercept](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/intercept) | Specifies the value where the trendline shall cross the y axis. This property shall be supported only<br/>            when the trendline type is exp, linear, or poly.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [display_equation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/display_equation) | Specifies that the equation for the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same label as the Rsquaredvalue).<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`bool`. |
| [order](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/order) | Specifies the order of the polynomial trend line. It is ignored for other trend line types. Value must be between 2 and 6.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`int`. |
| [period](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/period) | Specifies the period of the trend line for a moving average trend line. It is ignored for other trend<br/>            line variants. Value must be between 2 and 255.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`int`. |
| [display_r_squared_value](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/display_r_squared_value) | Specifies that the R-squared value of the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same label as the equation).<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`bool`. |
| [related_legend_entry](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/related_legend_entry) | Represents legend entry related with this trendline<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.charts.ILegendEntryProperties`. |
| [as_i_overridable_text](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/as_i_overridable_text) | Returns IOverridableText interface.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.charts.IOverridableText`. |
| [text_frame_for_overriding](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/text_frame_for_overriding) |  |
| [as_i_formatted_text_container](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/as_i_formatted_text_container) |  |
| [text_format](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/text_format) |  |
| [as_i_chart_component](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/as_i_chart_component) |  |
| [chart](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/chart) |  |
| [as_i_slide_component](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/as_i_slide_component) |  |
| [slide](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/slide) |  |
| [as_i_presentation_component](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/as_i_presentation_component) |  |
| [presentation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/presentation) |  |
