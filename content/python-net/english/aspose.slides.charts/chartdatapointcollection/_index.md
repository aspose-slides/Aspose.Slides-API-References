## ChartDataPointCollection class

Represents collection of a series data point.

The ChartDataPointCollection type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`data_source_type_for_x_values`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/chartdatapointcollection/data_source_type_for_x_values/) | Specifies whether AsCell or AsLiteralString or AsLiteralDouble property <br/>            is actual in data points XValue property object. In other words it specifies <br/>            the type of value of ChartDataPoint.XValue.Data property.<br/>            Read/write [`DataSourceType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/datasourcetype). |
