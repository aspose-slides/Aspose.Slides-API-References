## first_slice_angle property
Specifies the angle of the first pie or doughnut chart slice, 
            in degrees (clockwise from up, from 0 to 360 degrees).
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.FirstSliceAngle read/write property for change value.
            Read-only **int**.


### Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.FirstSliceAngle.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def first_slice_angle(self):
    ...
```
