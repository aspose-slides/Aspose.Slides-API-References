## doughnut_hole_size property
Specifies the size of the hole in a doughnut chart (can be between 10 and 90 percents 
            of the size of the plot area.).
            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.DoughnutHoleSize read/write property for change value.
            Read-only **int**.


### Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.DoughnutHoleSize.

### Definition:
