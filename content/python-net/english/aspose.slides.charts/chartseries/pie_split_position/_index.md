## pie_split_position property
Specifies a value that shall be used to determine which data points 
            are in the second pie or bar on a pie-of-pie or bar-of-pie chart.

            This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series 
            group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property 
            is read-only.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group.
            Use ParentSeriesGroup.PieSplitPosition read/write property for change value.
            Read-only **float**.
