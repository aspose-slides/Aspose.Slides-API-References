## is_visible property
False means that data label is not visible (and so all Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) are false).
            Read-only **bool**.


### Remarks

If data label is visible you can make it hidden with Hide() method.
            But if data label is not visible (IsVisible is false) you can make data label visible 
            with setting Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) to true state.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def is_visible(self):
    ...
```
