## hide {#}
Make data label hidden by setting all Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) to false state.
            IsVisible will be false after this.


```python
def hide(self):
    ...
```


### Remarks

If data label is not visible (IsVisible is false) you can make data label visible with 
            setting Show*-flags (ShowValue, ...) to true state.
