MathSpacingRules enumeration

Types of gap (horizontal spacing) between columns of a matrix

The MathSpacingRules type exposes the following members:

## Fields

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| SINGLE_SPACING_GAP | Single (1 em for columns or 1 line for rows) |
| ONE_AND_HALF_SPACING_GAP | One and a half (1.5 ems for columns or 1.5 lines for rows) |
| DOUBLE_SPACING_GAP | Double spacing (2 ems for columns or 2 lines for rows) |
| EXACTLY | Exactly value<br/>            For columns, rely on value of ColumnGap, measured in twips<br/>            For rows, rely on value of RowGap, measured in twips |
| MULTIPLE | Multiple<br/>            For columns, rely on value of ColumnGap, measured in 0.5 em increments<br/>            For rows, rely on value of RowGap, measured in lines |
