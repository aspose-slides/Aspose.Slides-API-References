## to_box {#}
Places this element in a non-visual box (logical grouping) 
            which is used to group components of an equation or other instance of mathematical text.
            A boxed object can (for example) serve as an operator emulator with or without an alignment point, 
            serve as a line break point, or be grouped such as not to allow line breaks within.

### Returns

Logical box with this element placed inside



```python
def to_box(self):
    ...
```
