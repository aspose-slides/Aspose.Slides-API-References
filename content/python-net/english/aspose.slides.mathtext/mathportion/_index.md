## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/mathportion/#IFieldType) |  |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/mathportion/#string) | Converts this portion to the automaticaly updated field. |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/mathportion/#) | Converts this field portion to the simple portion. |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/mathportion/#) | Get coordinates of rect that bounds portion. The rect includes all the lines of<br/>             text in portion, including empty ones. |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/mathportion/#) | Get coordinates of the beginning of the portion.
