## IMathArray class

Specifies a vertical array of equations or any mathematical objects

The IMathArray type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`arguments`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imatharray/arguments/) | The set of items of the array |
| [`base_justification`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imatharray/base_justification/) | Specifies alignment of the array relative to surrounding text<br/>            Text outside of the array can be aligned with the bottom, top, or center of a array object.<br/>            Default value: Center |
| [`maximum_distribution`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imatharray/maximum_distribution/) | Maximum Distribution<br/>            When true, the array is spaced to the maximum width of the containing element(page, column, cell, etc.). |
| [`object_distribution`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imatharray/object_distribution/) | Object Distribution<br/>            When true, the contents of the array are spaced to the maximum width of the array object. |
| [`row_spacing_rule`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imatharray/row_spacing_rule/) | The type of vertical spacing between array elements |
| [`row_spacing`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imatharray/row_spacing/) | Spacing between rows of an array<br/>            It is used only when RowSpacingRule is set to 3 Exactly in which case the unit of measure is points <br/>            or Multiple in which case the unit of measure is half-lines.<br/>            Default: 0 |
