## IMathNaryOperator class

Specifies an N-ary mathematical object, such as Summation and Integral.
            It consists of an operator, a base (or operand), and optional upper and lower limits. 
            Examples of N-ary operators are: Summation, Union, Intersection, Integral

The IMathNaryOperator type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`base`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imathnaryoperator/base/) | Base argument |
| [`subscript`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imathnaryoperator/subscript/) | Specifies a subscript argument that, for example, in the case of an integral, sets the lower limit |
| [`superscript`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imathnaryoperator/superscript/) | Specifies a supersript argument that, for example, in the case of an integral, sets the upper limit |
