## differential property
Differential
            When true, the box acts as a differential (e.g., 𝑑𝑥 in an integrand), and receives the appropriate 
            horizontal spacing for the mathematical differential.
            Default: false

### Definition:
```python
@property
def differential(self):
    ...
@differential.setter
def differential(self, value):
    ...
```
