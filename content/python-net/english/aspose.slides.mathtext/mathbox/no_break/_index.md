## no_break property
No break
            This property specifies the "unbreakable" property on the object box. When true, no line breaks can occur within the box.
            This can be important for operator emulators that consist of more than one binary operator. 
            When this element is not specified, breaks can occur inside box.
            Default: true

### Definition:
