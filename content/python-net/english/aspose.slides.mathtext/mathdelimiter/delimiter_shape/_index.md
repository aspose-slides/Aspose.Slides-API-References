## delimiter_shape property
Specifies the shape of delimiters in the delimiter object. 
            When is MathDelimiterShape.Centered, delimiters are centered around the math axis of the mathematical text 
            and still be made to fit the entire height of their contents.
            When is MathDelimiterShape.Match, their height and shape are altered to exactly match their contents.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def delimiter_shape(self):
    ...
@delimiter_shape.setter
def delimiter_shape(self, value):
    ...
```
