## operator_emulator property
Operator Emulator.
            When true, the box and its contents behave as a single operator and inherit the properties of an operator. 
            This means, for example, that the character can serve as a point for a line break and can be aligned to other operators.
            Operator Emulators are often used when one or more glyphs combine to form an operator, such as '=='.
            Default value: false
