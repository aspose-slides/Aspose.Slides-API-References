## disable_line_end_cropping property
SVG 1.1 lacks ability to define insets for markers.
            Aspose.Slides SVG writing engine has workaround for that problem:
            it crops end of line with arrow, so, line doesn't overlap markers.
            This option switches off such behavior.
            Read/write **bool**.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def disable_line_end_cropping(self):
    ...

@disable_line_end_cropping.setter
def disable_line_end_cropping(self, value):
    ...
```
