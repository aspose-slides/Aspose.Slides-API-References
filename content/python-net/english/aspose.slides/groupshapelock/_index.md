## GroupShapeLock class

Determines which operations are disabled on the parent GroupShape.

**Inheritance:**[`GroupShapeLock`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/groupshapelock) → [`BaseShapeLock`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/baseshapelock)

The GroupShapeLock type exposes the following members:
