## rotation property
Returns or sets the number of degrees the specified shape is rotated around
            the z-axis. A positive value indicates clockwise rotation; a negative value
            indicates counterclockwise rotation.
            Read/write **float**.


### Remarks

Returned value is always defined (is not float.NaN).
            Assigned value must be defined (not float.NaN). You can set undefined values for RawFrame instance properties.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def rotation(self):
    ...

@rotation.setter
def rotation(self, value):
    ...
```
