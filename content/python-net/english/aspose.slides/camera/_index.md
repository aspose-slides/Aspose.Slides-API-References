Camera class

Represents Camera.

**Inheritance:**[`Camera`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera) → [`PVIObject`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pviobject)

The Camera type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [as_i_presentation_component](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera/as_i_presentation_component/) | Allows to get base IPresentationComponent interface.<br/>            Read-only [`IPresentationComponent`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ipresentationcomponent). |
| [camera_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera/camera_type/) | Camera type.<br/>            Read/write [`CameraPresetType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camerapresettype). |
| [field_of_view_angle](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera/field_of_view_angle/) | Camera FOV (0-180 deg, field of View).<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [zoom](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera/zoom/) | Camera zoom (positive value in percentage).<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [slide](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera/slide/) |  |
| [presentation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera/presentation/) |  |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [set_rotation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera/set_rotation/#float-float-float/) | A rotation is defined through the use of a latitude<br/>            coordinate, a longitude coordinate, and a revolution about the axis <br/>            as the latitude and longitude coordinates.<br/>            If any of coordinate value is float.NaN, all rotation is undefined. |
| [get_rotation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camera/get_rotation/#/) | A rotation is defined through the use of a latitude<br/>            coordinate, a longitude coordinate, and a revolution about the axis <br/>            as the latitude and longitude coordinates.<br/>            first element in return array - latitude, second - longitude, third - revolution.<br/>            Returns null if no rotation defined. |
