| [`width`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/width/) | Gets the width of the image in pixels. |
| [`height`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/height/) | Gets the height of the image in pixels. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`save`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/save/#str) | Saves the image to a file. |
| [`save`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/save/#str-imageformat) | Saves the image to a file in the specified format. |
| [`save`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/save/#iorawiobase-imageformat) | Saves the image to a stream in the specified format. |
| [`save`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/save/#str-imageformat-int) | Saves the image to a file in the specified format and quality. |

### Remarks

This interface provides a common abstraction for handling both raster and vector images.  
            Implementations may vary depending on the underlying image type.
