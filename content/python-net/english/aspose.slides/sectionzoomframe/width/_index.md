## width property
Gets or sets the width of the shape, measured in points.
            Read/write **float**.


### Remarks

The value returned is always defined and never **float**.
            The value assigned must also be defined; assign **float** only to properties of a `RawFrame` instance.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def width(self):
    ...

@width.setter
def width(self, value):
    ...
```
