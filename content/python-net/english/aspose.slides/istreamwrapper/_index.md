IStreamWrapper class

Aspose.IO.Stream wrapper for COM interface.

The IStreamWrapper type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [stream](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/stream/) | Gets a stream.<br/>            Read-only <br/>.NET type System.IO.Stream<br/>. |
| [can_read](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/can_read/) | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports reading.<br/>            Read-only <br/>.NET type System.Boolean<br/>. |
| [can_seek](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/can_seek/) | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports seeking.<br/>            Read-only <br/>.NET type System.Boolean<br/>. |
| [can_write](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/can_write/) | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports writing.<br/>            Read-only <br/>.NET type System.Boolean<br/>. |
| [length](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/length/) | Gets the length in bytes of the stream.<br/>            Read-only <br/>.NET type System.Int64<br/>. |
| [position](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/position/) | Gets the position within the current stream.<br/>            Read-only <br/>.NET type System.Int64<br/>. |
| [as_i_disposable](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/as_i_disposable/) | Allows to get base IDisposable interface.<br/>            Read-only <br/>.NET type System.IDisposable<br/>. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [close](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/istreamwrapper/#/) | Closes the current stream and releases any resources. |
| [flush](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/istreamwrapper/#/) | Clears all buffers for this stream and causes any buffered data to be written to the underlying device. |
| [read](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/istreamwrapper/#bytes-int-int/) | Reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read. |
| [read_byte](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/istreamwrapper/#/) | Reads a byte from the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte, or returns -1 if at the end of the stream. |
| [seek](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/istreamwrapper/#int-System.IO.SeekOrigin/) | Sets the position within the current stream |
| [write](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/istreamwrapper/#bytes-int-int/) | writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written. |
| [write_byte](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/istreamwrapper/istreamwrapper/#int/) | Writes a byte to the current position in the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte. |
