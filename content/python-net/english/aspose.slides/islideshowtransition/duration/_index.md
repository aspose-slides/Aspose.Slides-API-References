## duration property
Gets or sets the duration of the slide transition effect in milliseconds.
            Read/write **int**.


### Remarks

Corresponds to the `p14:dur` attribute of the `p:transition` element in the PresentationML schema.
            If not set, the duration is determined automatically based on the [`ISlideShowTransition.speed`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/islideshowtransition/speed) property
            and the transition type.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def duration(self):
    ...

@duration.setter
def duration(self, value):
    ...
```
