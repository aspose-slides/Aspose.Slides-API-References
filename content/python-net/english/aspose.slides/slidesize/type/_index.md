## type property
Gets the slide size type.


### Remarks

Assigning any value other than [`SlideSizeType.CUSTOM`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidesizetype/CUSTOM) adjusts the [`SlideSize.size`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidesize/size)
            according to the predefined dimensions, while retaining the current [`SlideSize.orientation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidesize/orientation).
