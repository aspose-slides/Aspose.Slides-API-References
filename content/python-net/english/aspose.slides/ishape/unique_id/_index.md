## unique_id property
Returns an internal, presentation-scoped identifier intended for use by add-ins or other code.
            Because this value can be reassigned by the user or programmatically, it must not be treated
            as a persistent unique key.
            Read-only **int**.
            See also [`IShape.office_interop_shape_id`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ishape/office_interop_shape_id).
