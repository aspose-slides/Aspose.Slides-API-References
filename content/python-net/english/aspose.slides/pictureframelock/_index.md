## PictureFrameLock class

Determines which operations are disabled on the parent PictureFrame.

**Inheritance:**[`PictureFrameLock`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pictureframelock) → [`BaseShapeLock`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/baseshapelock)

The PictureFrameLock type exposes the following members:
