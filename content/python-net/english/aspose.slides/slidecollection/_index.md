## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/#ISlide) | Adds a copy of a specified slide to the end of the collection. |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/#ISlide-ISection) | Adds a copy of a specified slide to the end of the specified section. |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/#ISlide-ILayoutSlide) | Adds a copy of a specified slide to the end of the collection. |
