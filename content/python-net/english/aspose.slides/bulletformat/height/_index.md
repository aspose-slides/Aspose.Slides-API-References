## height property
Returns or sets the bullet height of a paragraph with no inheritance.
            Value float.NaN determines that bullet inherits height from the first portion in the paragraph.
            Read/write **float**.


### Remarks

A negative height value means that the height is given in points and
            a positive value means the height is a percentage of the surrounding text.

### Definition:
```python
@property
def height(self):
    ...

@height.setter
def height(self, value):
    ...
```
