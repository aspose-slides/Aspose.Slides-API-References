## type property
Returns or sets the type of slide size.
            Assigning any value except [`SlideSizeType.CUSTOM`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidesizetype#CUSTOM) will change [`ISlideSize.size`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/islidesize#size) accordingly, but will keep [`ISlideSize.orientation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/islidesize#orientation) intact.
            Read/write [`SlideSizeType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidesizetype).
