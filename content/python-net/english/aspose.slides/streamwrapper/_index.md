## StreamWrapper class

Aspose.IO.Stream wrapper for COM interface.

The StreamWrapper type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`stream`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/stream/) | Gets a stream.<br/>            Read-only **io.RawIOBase**. |
| [`can_read`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/can_read/) | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports reading.<br/>            Read-only **bool**. |
| [`can_seek`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/can_seek/) | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports seeking.<br/>            Read-only **bool**. |
| [`can_write`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/can_write/) | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports writing.<br/>            Read-only **bool**. |
| [`length`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/length/) | Gets the length in bytes of the stream.<br/>            Read-only **int**. |
| [`position`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/position/) | Gets or sets the position within the current stream.<br/>            Read-only **int**. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`close`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/close/#) | Closes the current stream and releases any resources. |
| [`flush`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/flush/#) | Clears all buffers for this stream and causes any buffered data to be written to the underlying device. |
| [`read`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/read/#bytes-int-int) | Reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read. |
| [`read_byte`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/read_byte/#) | Reads a byte from the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte, or returns -1 if at the end of the stream. |
| [`seek`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/seek/#int-systemioseekorigin) | Sets the position within the current stream |
| [`write`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/write/#bytes-int-int) | writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written. |
| [`write_byte`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/streamwrapper/write_byte/#int) | Writes a byte to the current position in the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte. |
