The PictureFillFormat type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [as_i_presentation_component](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/as_i_presentation_component) | Allows to get base IPresentationComponent interface.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.IPresentationComponent`. |
| [dpi](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/dpi) | Returns or sets the dpi which is used to fill a picture.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`int`. |
| [picture_fill_mode](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/picture_fill_mode) | Returns or sets the picture fill mode.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.PictureFillMode`. |
| [picture](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/picture) | Returns the picture.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.ISlidesPicture`. |
| [crop_left](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/crop_left) | Returns or sets the number of percents of real image width that are cropped off<br/>            the left of the picture. <br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [crop_top](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/crop_top) | Returns or sets the number of percents of real image height that are cropped off<br/>            the top of the picture. <br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [crop_right](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/crop_right) | Returns or sets the number of percents of real image width that are cropped off<br/>            the right of the picture. <br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
