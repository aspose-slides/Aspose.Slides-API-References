## ICameraEffectiveData class

Immutable object which contains effective camera properties.

The ICameraEffectiveData type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`camera_type`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icameraeffectivedata/camera_type/) | Camera type.<br/>            Read-only [`CameraPresetType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/camerapresettype). |
| [`field_of_view_angle`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icameraeffectivedata/field_of_view_angle/) | Camera FOV (0-180 deg, field of View).<br/>            Read-only **float**. |
| [`zoom`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icameraeffectivedata/zoom/) | Camera zoom (positive value in percentage).<br/>            Read-only **float**. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`get_rotation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icameraeffectivedata/get_rotation/#) | A rotation is defined through the use of a latitude<br/>            coordinate, a longitude coordinate, and a revolution about the axis <br/>            as the latitude and longitude coordinates.<br/>            first element in return array - latitude, second - longitude, third - revolution.<br/>            Returns null if no rotation defined. |


### Remarks

This interface is used as a part of [`IThreeDFormatEffectiveData`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ithreedformateffectivedata).
