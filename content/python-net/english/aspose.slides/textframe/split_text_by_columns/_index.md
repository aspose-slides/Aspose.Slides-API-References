## split_text_by_columns {#}
Splits the text content of the [`ITextFrame`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/itextframe) into an array of strings,  
            where each element corresponds to a separate text column within the frame.

### Returns

An array of strings, where each string represents the text content of a specific column  
            in the [`ITextFrame`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/itextframe).



```python
def split_text_by_columns(self):
    ...
```


### Remarks

If the text frame does not contain multiple columns, the returned array will have a single element  
            containing the full text.  
            Empty columns will be represented as empty strings in the array.
