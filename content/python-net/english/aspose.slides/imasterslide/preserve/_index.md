## preserve property
Determines whether the corresponding master is deleted when all 
            the slides that follow that master are deleted.
            Note: Aspose.Slides will never remove any unused master by itself, 
            to actually remove unused masters call [`IMasterSlideCollection.remove_unused`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/imasterslidecollection/remove_unused)
            Read/write **bool**.
