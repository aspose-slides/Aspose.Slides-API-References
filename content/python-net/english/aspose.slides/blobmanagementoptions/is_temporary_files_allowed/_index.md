## is_temporary_files_allowed property
This property defines if temporary files can be created while working with BLOBs, what greatly 
            decreases  the memory consumption but requires permissions to create files.
            All files will be deleted after work with the presentation will be finished.

```python
@property
def is_temporary_files_allowed(self):
