## Backdrop3DScene class

Defines a plane in which effects, such as glow and shadow, are applied in relation to the shape they are being applied to.

**Inheritance:**[`Backdrop3DScene`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/backdrop3dscene) → [`PVIObject`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pviobject)

The Backdrop3DScene type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [as_i_presentation_component](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/backdrop3dscene/as_i_presentation_component/) | Allows to get base IPresentationComponent interface.<br/>            Read-only [`IPresentationComponent`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ipresentationcomponent). |
| [normal_vector](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/backdrop3dscene/normal_vector/) | Returns or sets a normal vector. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector<br/>            normal to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values<br/>            which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single[]. |
| [anchor_point](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/backdrop3dscene/anchor_point/) | Returns or sets a point in 3D space. This point is the point in space that anchors the backdrop plane.<br/>            3D point represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single[]. |
| [up_vector](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/backdrop3dscene/up_vector/) | Returns or sets a vector representing up. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector<br/>            representing up in relation to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array<br/>            of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single[]. |
| [slide](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/backdrop3dscene/slide/) |  |
| [presentation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/backdrop3dscene/presentation/) |  |
