## ConnectorLock class

Determines which operations are disabled on the parent Connector.

**Inheritance:**[`ConnectorLock`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/connectorlock) → [`BaseShapeLock`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/baseshapelock)

The ConnectorLock type exposes the following members:

## Properties
