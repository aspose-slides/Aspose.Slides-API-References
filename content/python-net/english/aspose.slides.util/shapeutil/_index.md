## ShapeUtil class

Offer methods which helps to process shapes objects.

The ShapeUtil type exposes the following members:

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [graphics_path_to_geometry_path](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.util/shapeutil/graphics_path_to_geometry_path/#asposepydrawingdrawing2dgraphicspath) | Converts a .NET type System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath to the [`IGeometryPath`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/igeometrypath)<br/>            Return value of the method call can be used to change the geometry of a IGeometryShape object with<br/>            IGeometryShape.SetGeometryPaths method. |
| [geometry_path_to_graphics_path](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.util/shapeutil/geometry_path_to_graphics_path/#igeometrypath) | Converts [`IGeometryPath`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/igeometrypath) to .NET type System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.<br/>            <br/>            GraphicsPath can be transformed in a different ways using its convenient methods and then transformed back into<br/>            the [`IGeometryPath`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/igeometrypath) to use in [`GeometryShape`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/geometryshape) via Aspose.Slides.Util.ShapeUtil.GraphicsPathToGeometryPath(System.Drawing.Drawing2. method. |
