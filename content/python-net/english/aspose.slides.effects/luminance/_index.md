## Luminance class

Represents a Luminance effect.
            Brightness linearly shifts all colors closer to white or black.
            Contrast scales all colors to be either closer or further apart.

**Inheritance:**[`Luminance`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/luminance) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation) → [`PVIObject`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pviobject)

The Luminance type exposes the following members:
