## AlphaFloor class

Represents an Alpha Floor effect.
            Alpha (opacity) values less than 100% are changed to zero.
            In other words, anything partially transparent becomes fully transparent.

**Inheritance:**[`AlphaFloor`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/alphafloor) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation) → [`PVIObject`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pviobject)

The AlphaFloor type exposes the following members:
