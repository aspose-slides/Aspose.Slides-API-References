## AlphaCeiling class

Represents an Alpha Ceiling effect.
            Alpha (opacity) values greater than zero are changed to 100%.
            In other words, anything partially opaque becomes fully opaque.

**Inheritance:**[`AlphaCeiling`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/alphaceiling) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation) → [`PVIObject`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pviobject)

The AlphaCeiling type exposes the following members:
