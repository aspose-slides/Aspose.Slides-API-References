## GrayScale class

Represents a Gray Scale effect. Converts all effect color values to a shade of gray,
            corresponding to their luminance. Effect alpha (opacity) values are unaffected.

**Inheritance:**[`GrayScale`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/grayscale) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation)

The GrayScale type exposes the following members:
