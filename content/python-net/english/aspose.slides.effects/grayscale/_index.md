## GrayScale class

Represents a Gray Scale effect. Converts all effect color values to a shade of gray,
            corresponding to their luminance. Effect alpha (opacity) values are unaffected.

**Inheritance:**[`GrayScale`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/grayscale) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation) → [`PVIObject`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pviobject)

The GrayScale type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`slide`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/grayscale/slide/) |  |
| [`presentation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/grayscale/presentation/) |  |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`get_effective`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/grayscale/get_effective/#) | Gets effective Gray Scale effect data with the inheritance applied. |
