## HSL class

Represents a Hue/Saturation/Luminance effect.
            The hue, saturation, and luminance may each be adjusted relative to its current value.

**Inheritance:**[`HSL`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/hsl) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation) → [`PVIObject`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pviobject)

The HSL type exposes the following members:
