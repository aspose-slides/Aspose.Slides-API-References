Blur class

Represents a Blur effect that is applied to the entire shape, including its fill.
            All color channels, including alpha, are affected.

**Inheritance:**[`Blur`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/blur) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation)

The Blur type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [as_i_presentation_component](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/blur/as_i_presentation_component/) | Allows to get base IPresentationComponent interface.<br/>            Read-only [`IPresentationComponent`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ipresentationcomponent). |
| [radius](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/blur/radius/) | Returns or sets blur radius.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Double. |
| [grow](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/blur/grow/) | Determines whether the bounds of the object should be grown as a result of the blurring.<br/>            True indicates the bounds are grown while false indicates that they are not.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Boolean. |
| [slide](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/blur/slide/) |  |
| [presentation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/blur/presentation/) |  |
| [as_i_image_transform_operation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/blur/as_i_image_transform_operation/) |  |
