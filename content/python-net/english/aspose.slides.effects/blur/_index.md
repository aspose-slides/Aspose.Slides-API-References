## Blur class

Represents a Blur effect that is applied to the entire shape, including its fill.
            All color channels, including alpha, are affected.

**Inheritance:**[`Blur`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/blur) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation)

The Blur type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [as_i_presentation_component](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/as_i_presentation_component) | Allows to get base IPresentationComponent interface.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.IPresentationComponent`. |
| [radius](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/radius) | Returns or sets blur radius.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [grow](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/grow) | Determines whether the bounds of the object should be grown as a result of the blurring.<br/>            True indicates the bounds are grown while false indicates that they are not.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`bool`. |
| [slide](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/slide) |  |
| [presentation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/presentation) |  |
| [as_i_image_transform_operation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/as_i_image_transform_operation) |  |
