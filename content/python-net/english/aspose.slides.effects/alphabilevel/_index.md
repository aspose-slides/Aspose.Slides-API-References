## AlphaBiLevel class

Represents an Alpha Bi-Level effect.
            Alpha (Opacity) values less than the threshold are changed to 0 (fully transparent) and
            alpha values greater than or equal to the threshold are changed to 100% (fully opaque).

**Inheritance:**[`AlphaBiLevel`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/alphabilevel) → [`ImageTransformOperation`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.effects/imagetransformoperation)

The AlphaBiLevel type exposes the following members:
