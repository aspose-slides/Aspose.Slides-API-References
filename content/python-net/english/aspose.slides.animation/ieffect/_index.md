IEffect class

Represents animation effect.

The IEffect type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| [preset_class_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ieffect/preset_class_type/) | Defines class of effect.<br/>            Read/write <br/>[`EffectPresetClassType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effectpresetclasstype). |
| [type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ieffect/type/) | Defines type of effect.<br/>            Read/write <br/>[`EffectType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effecttype). |
| [subtype](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ieffect/subtype/) | Defines subtype of effect.<br/>            Read/write <br/>[`EffectSubtype`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effectsubtype). |
| [behaviors](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ieffect/behaviors/) | Returns collection of behavior for effect.<br/>            Read/write <br/>[`IBehaviorCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorcollection). |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ieffect/timing/) | Defines timing value for effect.<br/>            Read/write <br/>[`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
| [target_shape](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ieffect/target_shape/) | Returns target shape for effect.<br/>            Read-only <br/>[`IShape`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ishape). |
| [sound](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ieffect/sound/) | Defined embedded sound for effect.<br/>            Read/write <br/>[`IAudio`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iaudio). |
