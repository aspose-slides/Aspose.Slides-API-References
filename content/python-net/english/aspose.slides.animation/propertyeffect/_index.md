## PropertyEffect class

Represent property effect behavior.

**Inheritance:**[`PropertyEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The PropertyEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/__init__/#) |  |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`accumulate`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [`additive`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype). |
| [`properties`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only [`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorpropertycollection). |
| [`timing`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/timing/) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
| [`from_address`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/from_address/) | Specifies the starting value of the animation.<br/>            Read/write **string**. |
| [`to`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/to/) | Specifies the ending value for the animation.<br/>            Read/write **string**. |
| [`by`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/by/) | Specifies a relative offset value for the animation with respect to its<br/>            position before the start of the animation.<br/>            Read/write **string**. |
| [`value_type`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/value_type/) | Specifies the type of a property value.<br/>            Read/write [`PropertyValueType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyvaluetype). |
| [`calc_mode`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/calc_mode/) | Specifies the interpolation mode for the animation<br/>            Read/write [`PropertyCalcModeType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertycalcmodetype). |
| [`points`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyeffect/points/) | Specifies the points of the animation.<br/>            Read/write [`IPointCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ipointcollection). |
