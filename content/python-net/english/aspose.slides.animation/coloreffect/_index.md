ColorEffect class

Represents a color effect for an animation behavior.

**Inheritance:**[`ColorEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The ColorEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/__init__/#/) | Creates new instance. |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype). |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only [`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorpropertycollection). |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/timing/) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
| [from_address](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/from_address/) | This value is used to specify the starting color of behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`IColorFormat`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icolorformat). |
| [to](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/to/) | Describes resulting color for the animation color change.<br/>            Read/write [`IColorFormat`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icolorformat). |
| [by](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/by/) | Describes the relative offset value for the color animation.<br/>            Read/write [`IColorOffset`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloroffset). |
| [color_space](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/color_space/) | Represent color space of behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`ColorSpace`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/colorspace). |
| [direction](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/direction/) | Specifies which direction to cycle the hue around the color wheel.<br/>            Read/write [`ColorDirection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/colordirection). |
| [as_i_behavior](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/coloreffect/as_i_behavior/) |  |
