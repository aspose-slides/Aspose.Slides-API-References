## ITiming class

Represents animation timing.

The ITiming type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`accelerate`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/accelerate/) | Describes the percentage of duration accelerate behavior effect.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`decelerate`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/decelerate/) | Describes the percentage of duration decelerate behavior effect.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`auto_reverse`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/auto_reverse/) | Describes whether to automatically play the animation in reverse after<br/>            playing it in the forward direction.<br/>            Read/write **bool**. |
| [`duration`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/duration/) | Describes the duration of animation effect.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`repeat_count`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/repeat_count/) | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`repeat_until_end_slide`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/repeat_until_end_slide/) | This attribute specifies if the effect will repeat until the end of the slide.<br/>             Read/write **bool**. |
| [`repeat_until_next_click`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/repeat_until_next_click/) | This attribute specifies if the effect will repeat until the next click.<br/>             Read/write **bool**. |
| [`repeat_duration`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/repeat_duration/) | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`restart`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/restart/) | Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete.<br/>            Read/write [`EffectRestartType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effectrestarttype). |
| [`speed`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/speed/) | Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`trigger_delay_time`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/trigger_delay_time/) | Describes delay time after trigger.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`trigger_type`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/trigger_type/) | Describes trigger type.<br/>            Read/write [`EffectTriggerType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effecttriggertype). |
| [`rewind`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/rewind/) | This attribute specifies if the effect will rewind when done playing.<br/>             Read/write **bool**. |
