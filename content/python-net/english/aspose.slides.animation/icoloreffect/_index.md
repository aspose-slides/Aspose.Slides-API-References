## IColorEffect class

Represents a color effect for an animation behavior.

The IColorEffect type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [from_address](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/from_address/) | This value is used to specify the starting color of behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`IColorFormat`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icolorformat). |
| [to](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/to/) | Describes resulting color for the animation color change.<br/>            Read/write [`IColorFormat`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icolorformat). |
| [by](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/by/) | Describes the relative offset value for the color animation.<br/>            Read/write [`IColorOffset`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloroffset). |
| [color_space](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/color_space/) | Represent color space of behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`IColorEffect.color_space`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect#color_space). |
| [direction](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/direction/) | Specifies which direction to cycle the hue around the color wheel.<br/>            Read/write [`ColorDirection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/colordirection). |
| [as_i_behavior](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/as_i_behavior/) | Allows to get base IBehavior interface.<br/>            Read-only [`IBehavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehavior). |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/accumulate/) |  |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/additive/) |  |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/properties/) |  |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/icoloreffect/timing/) |  |
