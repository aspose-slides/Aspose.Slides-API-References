## IColorEffect class

Represents a color effect for an animation behavior.

The IColorEffect type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [from_address](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/from_address) | This value is used to specify the starting color of behavior.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.IColorFormat`. |
| [to](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/to) | Describes resulting color for the animation color change.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.IColorFormat`. |
| [by](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/by) | Describes the relative offset value for the color animation.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.IColorOffset`. |
