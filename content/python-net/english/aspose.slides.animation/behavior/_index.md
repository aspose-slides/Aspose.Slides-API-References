The Behavior type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype). |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only [`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorpropertycollection). |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior/timing/) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
