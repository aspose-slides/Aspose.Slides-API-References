## IScaleEffect class

Represents animation scale effect.

The IScaleEffect type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`zoom_content`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/iscaleeffect/zoom_content/) | Determines whether a content should be zoomed.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [`from_address`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/iscaleeffect/from_address/) | Specifies an x/y co-ordinate to start the animation from (in percents).<br/>            Read/write **aspose.pydrawing.PointF**. |
| [`to`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/iscaleeffect/to/) | Specifies the target location for an animation scale effect (in percents).<br/>            Read/write **aspose.pydrawing.PointF**. |
| [`by`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/iscaleeffect/by/) | describes the relative offset value for the animation (in percents).<br/>            Read/write **aspose.pydrawing.PointF**. |
| [`accumulate`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/iscaleeffect/accumulate/) |  |
