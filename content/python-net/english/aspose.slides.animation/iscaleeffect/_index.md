## IScaleEffect class

Represents animation scale effect.

The IScaleEffect type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [zoom_content](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/zoom_content) | Determines whether a content should be zoomed.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.NullableBool`. |
| [from_address](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/from_address) | Specifies an x/y co-ordinate to start the animation from (in percents).<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.pydrawing.PointF`. |
| [to](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/to) | Specifies the target location for an animation scale effect (in percents).<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.pydrawing.PointF`. |
| [by](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/by) | describes the relative offset value for the animation (in percents).<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.pydrawing.PointF`. |
| [as_i_behavior](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/as_i_behavior) | Allows to get base IBehavior interface.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.IBehavior`. |
