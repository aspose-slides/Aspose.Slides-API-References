## IPropertyEffect class

Represent property effect behavior.

The IPropertyEffect type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`from_address`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ipropertyeffect/from_address/) | Specifies the starting value of the animation.<br/>            Read/write **string**. |
| [`to`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ipropertyeffect/to/) | Specifies the ending value for the animation.<br/>            Read/write **string**. |
| [`by`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ipropertyeffect/by/) | Specifies a relative offset value for the animation with respect to its<br/>            position before the start of the animation.<br/>            Read/write **string**. |
| [`value_type`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ipropertyeffect/value_type/) | Specifies the type of a property value.<br/>            Read/write [`PropertyValueType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/propertyvaluetype). |
