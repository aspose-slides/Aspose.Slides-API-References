FilterEffect class

Represent filter effect of behavior.

**Inheritance:**[`FilterEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The FilterEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/filtereffect/#/) | Default constructor. |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.NullableBool`. |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.BehaviorAdditiveType`. |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.IBehaviorPropertyCollection`. |
