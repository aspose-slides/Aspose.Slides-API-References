## FilterEffect class

Represent filter effect of behavior.

**Inheritance:**[`FilterEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The FilterEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/__init__/#) | Default constructor. |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`accumulate`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [`additive`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype). |
| [`properties`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only [`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorpropertycollection). |
| [`timing`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/timing/) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
| [`reveal`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/reveal/) | Represents that effect with behavior must reveal (in/out)<br/>            Read/write [`FilterEffectRevealType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffectrevealtype). |
| [`type`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/type/) | Represents type of filter effect.<br/>            Read/write [`FilterEffectType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffecttype). |
| [`subtype`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffect/subtype/) | Represents subtype of filter effect.<br/>            Read/write [`FilterEffectSubtype`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/filtereffectsubtype). |
