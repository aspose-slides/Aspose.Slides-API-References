SetEffect class

Represents a set effect for an animation behavior.

**Inheritance:**[`SetEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/seteffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The SetEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/seteffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/seteffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype). |
