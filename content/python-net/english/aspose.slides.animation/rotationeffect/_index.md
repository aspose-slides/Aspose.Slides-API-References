## RotationEffect class

Represent rotation behavior of effect.

**Inheritance:**[`RotationEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The RotationEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/#) |  |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/accumulate) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.NullableBool`. |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/additive) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.BehaviorAdditiveType`. |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/properties) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.IBehaviorPropertyCollection`. |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.ITiming`. |
| [from_address](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/from_address) | Describes the starting value for the animation.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [to](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/to) | Describes the ending value for the animation.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [by](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/by) | Describes the relative offset value for the animation.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
