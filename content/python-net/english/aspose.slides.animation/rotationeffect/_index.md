## RotationEffect class

Represent rotation behavior of effect.

**Inheritance:**[`RotationEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The RotationEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/__init__/#) |  |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype). |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only [`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorpropertycollection). |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/timing/) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
| [from_address](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/from_address/) | Describes the starting value for the animation.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [to](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/to/) | Describes the ending value for the animation.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [by](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rotationeffect/by/) | Describes the relative offset value for the animation.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
