## Effect class

Represents animation effect.

The Effect type exposes the following members:
## Properties
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|sequence|Returns a sequence for an effect.<br/>            Read-only [ISequence](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/isequence/).|

|type|Defines type of effect.<br/>            Read/write [EffectType](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effecttype/).|
|subtype|Defines subtype of effect.<br/>            Read/write [EffectSubtype](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effectsubtype/).|
|behaviors|Returns collection of behavior for effect.<br/>            Read/write [IBehaviorCollection](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorcollection/).|
|timing|Defines timing value for effect.<br/>            Read/write [ITiming](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming/).|
|target_shape|Returns target shape for effect.<br/>            Read-only [IShape](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ishape/).|
|sound|Defined embedded sound for effect.<br/>            Read/write [IAudio](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iaudio/).|
|stop_previous_sound|This attribute specifies if the animation effect stops the previous sound.<br/>            Read/write bool.|
