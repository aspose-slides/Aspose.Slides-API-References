Effect class

Represents animation effect.

The Effect type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [sequence](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/sequence/) | Returns a sequence for an effect.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.ISequence`. |
| [text_animation](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/text_animation/) | TextAnimation<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.ITextAnimation`. |
| [preset_class_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/preset_class_type/) | Defines class of effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.EffectPresetClassType`. |
| [type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/type/) | Defines type of effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.EffectType`. |
| [subtype](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/subtype/) | Defines subtype of effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.EffectSubtype`. |
| [behaviors](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/behaviors/) | Returns collection of behavior for effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.IBehaviorCollection`. |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/timing/) | Defines timing value for effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.ITiming`. |
| [target_shape](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/target_shape/) | Returns target shape for effect.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.IShape`. |
| [sound](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/sound/) | Defined embedded sound for effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.IAudio`. |
| [stop_previous_sound](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/stop_previous_sound/) | This attribute specifies if the animation effect stops the previous sound.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`bool`. |
| [after_animation_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/after_animation_type/) | Defines an after animation type for effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:attr:`aspose.slides.animation.Effect.after_animation_type`. |
| [after_animation_color](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/after_animation_color/) | Defines an after animation color for effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.IColorFormat`. |
| [animate_text_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/animate_text_type/) | Defines an animate text type for effect. <br/>            The shape text can be animated by letter, by word or all at once.<br/>            Read/write :py:attr:`aspose.slides.animation.Effect.animate_text_type`. |
| [delay_between_text_parts](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/delay_between_text_parts/) | Defines a delay between animated text parts (words or letters).<br/>            A positive value specifies the percentage of effect duration.<br/>            A negative value specifies the delay in seconds.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
