## Effect class

Represents animation effect.

The Effect type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |

| [preset_class_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/preset_class_type/) | Defines class of effect.<br/>            Read/write [`EffectPresetClassType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effectpresetclasstype). |
| [type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/type/) | Defines type of effect.<br/>            Read/write [`EffectType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effecttype). |
| [subtype](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/subtype/) | Defines subtype of effect.<br/>            Read/write [`EffectSubtype`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effectsubtype). |
| [behaviors](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/behaviors/) | Returns collection of behavior for effect.<br/>            Read/write [`IBehaviorCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorcollection). |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/timing/) | Defines timing value for effect.<br/>            Read/write [`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
| [target_shape](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/target_shape/) | Returns target shape for effect.<br/>            Read-only [`IShape`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ishape). |
| [sound](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/sound/) | Defined embedded sound for effect.<br/>            Read/write [`IAudio`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iaudio). |
| [stop_previous_sound](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/stop_previous_sound/) | This attribute specifies if the animation effect stops the previous sound.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Boolean. |
