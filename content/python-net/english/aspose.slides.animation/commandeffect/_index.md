## CommandEffect class

Represents a command effect for an animation behavior.

**Inheritance:**[`CommandEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The CommandEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/#) | Creates new instance. |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/accumulate) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.NullableBool`. |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/additive) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.BehaviorAdditiveType`. |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/properties) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.IBehaviorPropertyCollection`. |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.ITiming`. |
| [type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/type) | Defines command effect type of behavior.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.CommandEffectType`. |
| [command_string](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/command_string) | Defines command string.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`System.String`. |
| [shape_target](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/shape_target) | Defines shape target of command effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.IShape`. |
