CommandEffect class

Represents a command effect for an animation behavior.

**Inheritance:**[`CommandEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The CommandEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/commandeffect/#/) | Creates new instance. |

## Properties

| Property | Description |

| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write <br/>[`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype)<br/>. |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only <br/>[`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorpropertycollection)<br/>. |
