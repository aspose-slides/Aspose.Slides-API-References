CommandEffect class

Represents a command effect for an animation behavior.

**Inheritance:**[`CommandEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The CommandEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/__init__/#) | Creates new instance. |

## Properties

| Property | Description |

| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype). |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only [`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorpropertycollection). |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/timing/) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
| [type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/type/) | Defines command effect type of behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`CommandEffectType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffecttype). |
| [command_string](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/command_string/) | Defines command string.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.String. |
| [shape_target](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/commandeffect/shape_target/) | Defines shape target of command effect.<br/>            Read/write [`IShape`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ishape). |
