ScaleEffect class

Represents animation scale effect.

**Inheritance:**[`ScaleEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The ScaleEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/scaleeffect/#/) |  |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.NullableBool`. |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.BehaviorAdditiveType`. |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.IBehaviorPropertyCollection`. |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/timing/) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.slides.animation.ITiming`. |
| [zoom_content](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/zoom_content/) | Determines whether a content should be zoomed.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.NullableBool`. |
| [from_address](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/from_address/) | Specifies an x/y co-ordinate to start the animation from (in percents).<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.pydrawing.PointF`. |
| [to](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/to/) | Specifies the target location for an animation scale effect (in percents).<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.pydrawing.PointF`. |
| [by](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/by/) | describes the relative offset value for the animation (in percents).<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`aspose.pydrawing.PointF`. |
| [as_i_behavior](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/scaleeffect/as_i_behavior/) |  |
