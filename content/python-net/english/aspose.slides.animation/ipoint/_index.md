Represent animation point.

The IPoint type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`time`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ipoint/time/) | Represents time value.<br/>            Read/write **float**. |
| [`value`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ipoint/value/) | Represents point value.<br/>            Only: bool, ColorFormat, float, int, string.<br/>            Read/write **any**. |
| [`formula`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ipoint/formula/) | Formulas within values, from, to, by attributes can be made up of these:<br/>            Standard arithmetic operators: ‘+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘^’, ‘%’ (mod)<br/>            Constants: ‘pi’ ‘e’<br/>            Conditional operators: ‘abs’, ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘?’ (if)<br/>            Comparison operators: '==', '>=', '', '!=', '!'<br/>            Trigonometric operators: ‘sin()’, ‘cos()’, ‘tan()’, ‘asin()’, ‘acos()’, ‘atan()’<br/>            Natural logarithm ‘ln()’<br/>            Property references (host supported properties)<br/>            <br/>            for example: "#ppt_x+(cos(-2*pi*(1-$))*-#ppt_x-sin(-2*pi*(1-$))*(1-#ppt_y))*(1-$)"<br/>            Read/write **str**. |
