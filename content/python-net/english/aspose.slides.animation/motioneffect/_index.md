MotionEffect class

Represent motion effect behavior of effect.

**Inheritance:**[`MotionEffect`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect) → [`Behavior`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavior)

The MotionEffect type exposes the following members:

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/__init__/#/) |  |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accumulate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/accumulate/) | Represents whether animation behaviors are accumulated.<br/>            Read/write [`NullableBool`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/nullablebool). |
| [additive](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/additive/) | Represents whether the current animation behavior is combined with other running animations.<br/>            Read/write [`BehaviorAdditiveType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/behavioradditivetype). |
| [properties](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/properties/) | Represents properties of behavior.<br/>            Read-only [`IBehaviorPropertyCollection`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/ibehaviorpropertycollection). |
| [timing](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/timing/) | Represents timing properties for the effect behavior.<br/>            Read/write [`ITiming`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/itiming). |
| [from_address](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/from_address/) | Specifies an x/y co-ordinate to start the animation from (in percents). <br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Drawing.PointF. |
| [to](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/to/) | Specifies the target location for an animation motion effect (in percents).<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Drawing.PointF. |
| [by](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/by/) | Describes the relative offset value for the animation (in percents).<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Drawing.PointF. |
| [rotation_center](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/rotation_center/) | Describes the center of the rotation used to rotate a motion path by X angle.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Drawing.PointF. |
| [origin](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/origin/) | Specifies what the origin of the motion path is relative to such as the layout of the slide,<br/>            or the parent.<br/>            Read/write [`MotionOriginType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motionorigintype). |
| [path](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/path/) | Specifies the path primitive followed by coordinates for the animation motion.<br/>            Read/write [`IMotionPath`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/imotionpath). |
| [path_edit_mode](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/path_edit_mode/) | Specifies how the motion path moves when shape is moved.<br/>            Read/write [`MotionPathEditMode`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motionpatheditmode). |
| [angle](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/motioneffect/angle/) | Describes the relative angle of the motion path.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
