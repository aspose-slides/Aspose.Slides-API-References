## Timing class

Represents animation timing.

The Timing type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accelerate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/accelerate/) | Describes the percentage of duration accelerate behavior effect.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [decelerate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/decelerate/) | Describes the percentage of duration decelerate behavior effect.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [auto_reverse](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/auto_reverse/) | Describes whether to automatically play the animation in reverse after<br/>            playing it in the forward direction.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Boolean. |
| [duration](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/duration/) | Describes the duration of animation effect.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [repeat_count](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/repeat_count/) | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [repeat_until_end_slide](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/repeat_until_end_slide/) | This attribute specifies if the effect will repeat until the end of the slide.<br/>             Read/write .NET type System.Boolean. |
| [repeat_until_next_click](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/repeat_until_next_click/) | This attribute specifies if the effect will repeat until the next click.<br/>             Read/write .NET type System.Boolean. |
| [repeat_duration](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/repeat_duration/) | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [restart](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/restart/) | Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete.<br/>            Read/write [`EffectRestartType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effectrestarttype). |
| [rewind](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/rewind/) | This attribute specifies if the effect will rewind when done playing.<br/>             Read/write .NET type System.Boolean. |
| [speed](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/speed/) | Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [trigger_delay_time](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/trigger_delay_time/) | Describes delay time after trigger.<br/>            Read/write .NET type System.Single. |
| [trigger_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/trigger_type/) | Describes trigger type.<br/>            Read/write [`EffectTriggerType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/effecttriggertype). |
