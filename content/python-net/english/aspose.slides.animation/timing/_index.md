## Timing class

Represents animation timing.

The Timing type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [accelerate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/accelerate) | Describes the percentage of duration accelerate behavior effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [decelerate](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/decelerate) | Describes the percentage of duration decelerate behavior effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [auto_reverse](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/auto_reverse) | Describes whether to automatically play the animation in reverse after<br/>            playing it in the forward direction.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`bool`. |
| [duration](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/duration) | Describes the duration of animation effect.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [repeat_count](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/repeat_count) | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [repeat_until_end_slide](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/repeat_until_end_slide) | This attribute specifies if the effect will repeat until the end of the slide.<br/>             Read/write :py:class:`bool`. |
| [repeat_until_next_click](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/repeat_until_next_click) | This attribute specifies if the effect will repeat until the next click.<br/>             Read/write :py:class:`bool`. |
| [repeat_duration](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/repeat_duration) | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [restart](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/restart) | Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.EffectRestartType`. |
| [rewind](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/rewind) | This attribute specifies if the effect will rewind when done playing.<br/>             Read/write :py:class:`bool`. |
| [speed](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/speed) | Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [trigger_delay_time](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/trigger_delay_time) | Describes delay time after trigger.<br/>            Read/write :py:class:`float`. |
| [trigger_type](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/trigger_type) | Describes trigger type.<br/>            Read/write :py:enum:`aspose.slides.animation.EffectTriggerType`. |
