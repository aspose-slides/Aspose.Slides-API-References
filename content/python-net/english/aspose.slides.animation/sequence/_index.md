Sequence class

Represents sequence (collection of effects).

The Sequence type exposes the following members:

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [count](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/sequence/count/) | Returns the number of effects in a sequense.<br/>            Read-only .NET type System.Int32. |
| [trigger_shape](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/sequence/trigger_shape/) | Returns or sets shape target for INTERACTIVE sequence.<br/>            If sequence is not interactive then returns null.<br/>            Read/write [`IShape`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ishape). |
| [as_i_enumerable](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/sequence/as_i_enumerable/) |  |
