| [`IInkActions`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.ink/iinkactions/) | Represents an ink object on a slide. |
| [`IInkBrush`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.ink/iinkbrush/) | Represents trace brush. |
| [`IInkTrace`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.ink/iinktrace/) | Represents handwritten line in an Ink object. |
| [`Ink`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.ink/ink/) | Represents an ink object on a slide. |
| [`InkActions`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.ink/inkactions/) | Represents the root of ink actions. |
| [`InkBrush`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.ink/inkbrush/) | Represents an inkBrush object. |
| [`InkTrace`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.ink/inktrace/) | Represents an Trace object.<br/>            A Trace element is used to record the data captured by the digitizer. <br/>            It contains a sequence of points encoded according to the specification given by the InkTraceFormat object. |

## Enumerations

| Enumeration | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`InkEffectType`](/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.ink/inkeffecttype/) | Specifies a set of predefined visual effects for ink rendering.<br/>            Each effect corresponds to a texture or image that simulates a stylized ink appearance.<br/>            These values can be used to customize the visual style of digital ink strokes during rendering. |
