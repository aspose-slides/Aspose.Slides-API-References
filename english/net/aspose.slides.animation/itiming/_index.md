## ITiming interface

Represents animation timing.

```csharp
public interface ITiming
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Accelerate](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/accelerate) { get; set; } | Describes the percentage of duration accelerate behavior effect. Read/write Single. |
| [AutoReverse](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/autoreverse) { get; set; } | Describes whether to automatically play the animation in reverse after playing it in the forward direction. Read/write Boolean. |
| [Decelerate](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/decelerate) { get; set; } | Describes the percentage of duration decelerate behavior effect. Read/write Single. |
| [Duration](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/duration) { get; set; } | Describes the duration of animation effect. Read/write Single. |
| [RepeatCount](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/repeatcount) { get; set; } | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write Single. |
| [RepeatDuration](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/repeatduration) { get; set; } | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write Single. |
| [Restart](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/restart) { get; set; } | Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete. Read/write [`EffectRestartType`](../effectrestarttype). |
| [Speed](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/speed) { get; set; } | Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing. Read/write Single. |
| [TriggerDelayTime](../../aspose.slides.animation/itiming/triggerdelaytime) { get; set; } | Describes delay time after trigger. Read/write Single. |
