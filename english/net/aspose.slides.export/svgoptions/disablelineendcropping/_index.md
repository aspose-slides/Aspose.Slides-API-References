## SVGOptions.DisableLineEndCropping property

SVG 1.1 lacks ability to define insets for markers. Aspose.Slides SVG writing engine has workaround for that problem: it crops end of line with arrow, so, line doesn't overlap markers. This option switches off such behavior. Read/write Boolean.

```csharp
public bool DisableLineEndCropping { get; set; }
```
