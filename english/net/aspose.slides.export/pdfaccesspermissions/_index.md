## PdfAccessPermissions enumeration

Contains a set of flags specifying which access permissions should be granted when the document is opened with user access.

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum PdfAccessPermissions
```

## Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `0x0` | Specifies that a user does not have access permissions. |
| PrintDocument | `0x4` | Specifies whether a user may print the document (possibly not at the highest quality level, depending on whether bit HighQualityPrint is also set). |
| ModifyContent | `0x8` | Specifies whether a user may modify the contents of the document by operations other than those controlled by bits AddOrModifyFields, FillExistingFields, AssembleDocument. |
| CopyTextAndGraphics | `0x10` | Specifies whether a user may copy or otherwise extract text and graphics from the document by operations other than that controlled by bit ExtractTextAndGraphics. |
| AddOrModifyFields | `0x20` | Specifies whether a user may add or modify text annotations, fill in interactive form fields, and, if bit ModifyContent is also set, create or modify interactive form fields (including signature fields). |
| FillExistingFields | `0x100` | Specifies whether a user may fill in existing interactive form fields (including signature fields), even if bit AddOrModifyFields is clear. |
| ExtractTextAndGraphics | `0x200` | Specifies whether a user may extract text and graphics in support of accessibility to users with disabilities or for other purposes. |
| AssembleDocument | `0x400` | Specifies whether a user may assemble the document (insert, rotate, or delete pages and create bookmarks or thumbnail images), even if bit ModifyContent is clear. |
| HighQualityPrint | `0x800` | Specifies whether a user may print the document to a representation from which a faithful digital copy of the PDF content could be generated. When this bit is clear (and bit PrintDocument is set), printing is limited to a low-level representation of the appearance, possibly of degraded quality. |
