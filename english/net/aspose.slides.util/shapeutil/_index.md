GraphicsPath can be transformed in a different ways using its convenient methods and then transformed back into the [`IGeometryPath`](../../aspose.slides/igeometrypath) to use in [`GeometryShape`](../../aspose.slides/geometryshape) via [`GraphicsPathToGeometryPath`](./graphicspathtogeometrypath) method. |
| static [GraphicsPathToGeometryPath](graphicspathtogeometrypath)(…) | Converts a GraphicsPath to the [`IGeometryPath`](../../aspose.slides/igeometrypath) Return value of the method call can be used to change the geometry of a IGeometryShape object with IGeometryShape.SetGeometryPaths method. |
