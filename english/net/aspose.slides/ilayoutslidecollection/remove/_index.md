Removes a layout from the collection.

```csharp
public void Remove(ILayoutSlide value)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| value | The layout slide to remove from the collection. |

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| [PptxEditException](../../pptxeditexception) | Thrown if layout is used in presentation (its HasDependingSlides property is true). |

## Remarks

1) To avoid throwing of the PptxEditException check layout's HasDependingSlides property before. 2) You can use also [`Remove`](../../ilayoutslide/remove) method to simplify code.
