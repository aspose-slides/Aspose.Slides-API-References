## IBlobManagementOptions.IsTemporaryFilesAllowed property

This property defines if temporary files can be created while working with BLOBs, what greatly decreases the memory consumption but requires permissions to create files. All files will be deleted after work with the presentation will be finished.

```csharp
public bool IsTemporaryFilesAllowed { get; set; }
```
