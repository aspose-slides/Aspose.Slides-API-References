## BlobManagementOptions.MaxBlobsBytesInMemory property

A threshold that indicates the maximum amount of bytes which BLOBs can occupied in memory. After this threshold was reached, all new BLOBs will be placed in temporary files and will not affect the total memory consumption of the process. [`IsTemporaryFilesAllowed`](../istemporaryfilesallowed) should be set to true to use this property.

```csharp
public ulong MaxBlobsBytesInMemory { get; set; }
```
