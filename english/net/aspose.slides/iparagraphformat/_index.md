```csharp
public interface IParagraphFormat
```

## Remarks

This class is used to return and manipulate paragraph formatting properties defined for the particular paragraph. This means that no inheritance is applied when getting values so for the majority of cases you will get values meaning "undefined".

In order to get the effective formatting parameter values including inherited you need to use [`GetEffective`](./geteffective) method which returns a [`IParagraphFormatEffectiveData`](../iparagraphformateffectivedata) instance.
