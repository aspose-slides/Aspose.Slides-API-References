## StreamWrapper class

Aspose.IO.Stream wrapper for COM interface.

```csharp
public class StreamWrapper : IStreamWrapper
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AsIDisposable](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/asidisposable) { get; } | Allows to get base IDisposable interface. Read-only IDisposable. |
| [CanRead](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/canread) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports reading. Read-only Boolean. |
| [CanSeek](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/canseek) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports seeking. Read-only Boolean. |
| [CanWrite](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/canwrite) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports writing. Read-only Boolean. |
| [Length](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/length) { get; } | Gets the length in bytes of the stream. Read-only Int64. |
| [Position](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/position) { get; } | Gets or sets the position within the current stream. Read-only Int64. |
| [Stream](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/stream) { get; } | Gets a stream. Read-only Stream. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Close](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/close)() | Closes the current stream and releases any resources. |
| [Dispose](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/dispose)() | Disposes object. |
| [Flush](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/flush)() | Clears all buffers for this stream and causes any buffered data to be written to the underlying device. |
| [Read](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/read)(byte[], int, int) | Reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read. |
| [ReadByte](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/readbyte)() | Reads a byte from the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte, or returns -1 if at the end of the stream. |
| [Seek](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/seek)(long, SeekOrigin) | Sets the position within the current stream |
| [Write](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/write)(byte[], int, int) | writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written. |
| [WriteByte](../../aspose.slides/streamwrapper/writebyte)(byte) | Writes a byte to the current position in the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte. |
