## ILoadOptions.OnlyLoadDocumentProperties property

This property makes sense, if presentation file is password protected. Value of true means that only document properties must be loaded from an encrypted presentation file and password must be ignored. Value of false means that entire encrypted presentation must be loaded with use of right password. If presentation isn't encrypted then property value is always ignored. If document properties of an encrypted file aren't public and property value is true then document properties cannot be loaded and exception will be thrown. Read-write Boolean.

```csharp
public bool OnlyLoadDocumentProperties { get; set; }
```
