## PresentationLockingBehavior enumeration

Represents the behavior regarding treating the [`IPresentation`](../ipresentation) source (file or Stream) while loading and working with an instance of [`IPresentation`](../ipresentation).

```csharp
public enum PresentationLockingBehavior
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LoadAndRelease | `0` | The source will be locked only for a time of [`IPresentation`](../ipresentation) constructor execution. If [`IsTemporaryFilesAllowed`](../iblobmanagementoptions/istemporaryfilesallowed) is set to false, all BLOBs will be loaded into memory. Otherwise, other means such a temporary files might be used.This behavior is slower than KeepLocked, and if it is possible to pass the ownership of the source to [`IPresentation`](../ipresentation), it is recommended to use KeepLocked. |
| KeepLocked | `1` | The source will be locked for a whole lifetime of [`IPresentation`](../ipresentation) instance, until it will be disposed. [`IsTemporaryFilesAllowed`](../iblobmanagementoptions/istemporaryfilesallowed) is must be set to true for using this behavior, otherwise exception will be thrown.This behavior is recommended, it is faster and consumes less memory than LoadAndRelease. |

### Remarks

The source is the parameter passed to the [`IPresentation`](../ipresentation) constructor. In the example below, the source is the "pres.pptx" file:

```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions { 
  BlobManagementOptions = { PresentationLockingBehavior = PresentationLockingBehavior.KeepLocked } };
using (IPresentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx", loadOptions)) { }
```

For this example, the source ("pres.pptx" file) will be locked for a [`IPresentation`](../ipresentation) instance lifetime, i.e. can't be changed or deleted by the other process.
