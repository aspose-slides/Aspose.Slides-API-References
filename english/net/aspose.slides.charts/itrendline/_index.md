| [DisplayEquation](displayequation) { get; set; } | Specifies that the equation for the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same label as the Rsquaredvalue). Read/write Boolean. |
| [DisplayRSquaredValue](displayrsquaredvalue) { get; set; } | Specifies that the R-squared value of the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same label as the equation). Read/write Boolean. |
| [Format](format) { get; set; } | Represents the format of the trend line. Read/write [`IFormat`](../iformat). |
| [Forward](forward) { get; set; } | Specifies the number of categories (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends after the data for the series that is being trended. On scatter and non-scatter charts, the value shall be any non-negative value. Read/write Double. |
