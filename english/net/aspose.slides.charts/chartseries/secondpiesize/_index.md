## ChartSeries.SecondPieSize property

Specifies the size of the second pie or bar of a pie-of-pie chart or a bar-of-pie chart, as a percentage of the size of the first pie (can be between 5 and 200 percents). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.SecondPieSize read/write property for change value. Read-only UInt16.

```csharp
public ushort SecondPieSize { get; }
```

## Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.SecondPieSize.
