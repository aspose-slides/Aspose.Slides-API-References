## ChartSeries.BubbleSizeScale property

Specifies the scale factor for the bubble chart (can be between 0 and 300 percents of the default size). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.BubbleSizeScale read/write property for change value.

```csharp
public int BubbleSizeScale { get; }
```

## Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.BubbleSizeScale.
