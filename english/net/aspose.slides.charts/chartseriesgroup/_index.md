public class ChartSeriesGroup : IChartSeriesGroup
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [BubbleSizeRepresentation](bubblesizerepresentation) { get; set; } | Specifies how the bubble size values are represented on the bubble chart. Read/write [`BubbleSizeRepresentationType`](../bubblesizerepresentationtype). |
| [BubbleSizeScale](bubblesizescale) { get; set; } | Specifies the scale factor for the bubble chart (can be between 0 and 300 percents of the default size). Read/write Int32. |
| [Chart](chart) { get; } | Returns the parent chart. Read-only [`IChart`](../ichart). |
| [DoughnutHoleSize](doughnutholesize) { get; set; } | Specifies the size of the hole in a doughnut chart (can be between 0 and 90 percents of the size of the plot area.). Read/write Byte. |
| [FirstSliceAngle](firstsliceangle) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the angle of the first pie or doughnut chart slice, in degrees (clockwise from up, from 0 to 360 degrees). Read/write UInt16. |
| [GapDepth](gapdepth) { get; set; } | Returns or sets the distance, as a percentage of the marker width, between the data series in a 3D chart. Read/write UInt16. |

| [HasSeriesLines](hasserieslines) { get; set; } | True if chart has series lines. Applied to stacked bar and OfPie charts. Read/write Boolean. |
| [HiLowLinesFormat](hilowlinesformat) { get; } | Specifies HiLowLines format. HiLowLines applied with HiLowClose, OpenHiLowClose, VolumeHiLowClose and VolumeOpenHiLowClose chart types. |
| [IsColorVaried](iscolorvaried) { get; set; } | Specifies that each data marker in the series has a different color. Read/write Boolean. |
| [Item](item) { get; } | Gets the element at the specified index. |
| [Overlap](overlap) { get; set; } | Specifies how much bars and columns shall overlap on 2-D charts (from -100 to 100). Read/write SByte. |
| [PieSplitBy](piesplitby) { get; set; } | Specifies how to determine which data points are in the second pie or bar on a pie-of-pie or bar-of-pie chart. Read/write [`PieSplitType`](../piesplittype). |
| [PieSplitCustomPoints](piesplitcustompoints) { get; } | The custom split information for a pie-of-pie or bar-of-pie chart with a custom split. Contains data points that shall be drawn in the second pie or bar in a pie-of-pie or bar-of-pie chart. Read-only [`PieSplitCustomPointCollection`](../piesplitcustompointcollection). |
| [PieSplitPosition](piesplitposition) { get; set; } | Specifies a value that shall be used to determine which data points are in the second pie or bar on a pie-of-pie or bar-of-pie chart. Is used together with PieSplitBy property. Read/write Double. |
| [PlotOnSecondAxis](plotonsecondaxis) { get; } | Indicates if series of this group is plotted on secondary axis. Read-only Boolean. |
| [SecondPieSize](secondpiesize) { get; set; } | Specifies the size of the second pie or bar of a pie-of-pie chart or a bar-of-pie chart, as a percentage of the size of the first pie (can be between 5 and 200 percents). Read/write UInt16. |
| [Series](series) { get; } | Returns a collection of series. Read-only [`IChartSeriesReadonlyCollection`](../ichartseriesreadonlycollection). |
| [Type](type) { get; } | Returns a type of this series group. Read-only [`CombinableSeriesTypesGroup`](../combinableseriestypesgroup). |

## Remarks

1) See summary and remarks for ChartSeriesGroupCollection class and CombinableSeriesTypesGroup enum. 2) Group of series contains some series properies whitch is common for each series in group ("series group properties"). "Series group properties" in ChartSeriesGroup class is read/write. Each of "series group properties" can have a read-only projection in ChartSeries class.
