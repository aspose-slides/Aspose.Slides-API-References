Returns or sets the distance, as a percentage of the marker width, between the data series in a 3D chart. This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.GapDepth read/write property for change value. Read-only Int32.

```csharp
public int GapDepth { get; }
```

## Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.GapDepth.
