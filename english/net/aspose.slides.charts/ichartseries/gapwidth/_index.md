## IChartSeries.GapWidth property

Specifies the space between bar or column clusters, as a percentage of the bar or column width. This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.GapWidth read/write property for change value. Read-only Int32.

```csharp
public int GapWidth { get; }
```

## Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.GapWidth.
