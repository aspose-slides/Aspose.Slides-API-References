## IChartSeries.FirstSliceAngle property

Specifies the angle of the first pie or doughnut chart slice, in degrees (clockwise from up, from 0 to 360 degrees). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.FirstSliceAngle read/write property for change value. Read-only UInt16.

```csharp
public ushort FirstSliceAngle { get; }
```

### Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.FirstSliceAngle.
