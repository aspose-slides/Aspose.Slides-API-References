## IChartSeries.Overlap property

Specifies how much bars and columns shall overlap on 2-D charts (from -100 to 100). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap read/write property for change value. Read-only SByte.

```csharp
public sbyte Overlap { get; }
```

## Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.Overlap.
