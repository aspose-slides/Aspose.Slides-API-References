## IChartSeries.PieSplitBy property

Specifies how to determine which data points are in the second pie or bar on a pie-of-pie or bar-of-pie chart. This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.PieSplitBy read/write property for change value. Read-only [`PieSplitType`](../../piesplittype).

```csharp
public PieSplitType PieSplitBy { get; }
```

## Remarks

1) This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.PieSplitBy. 2) If property value is PieSplitType.Custom then you can define custom split information with ParentSeriesGroup.PieSplitCustomPoints property.
