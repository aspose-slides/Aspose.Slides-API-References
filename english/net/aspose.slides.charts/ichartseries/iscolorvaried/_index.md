## IChartSeries.IsColorVaried property

Specifies that each data marker in the series has a different color. This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.IsColorVaried read/write property for change value. Read-only Boolean.

```csharp
public bool IsColorVaried { get; }
```

## Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.IsColorVaried.
