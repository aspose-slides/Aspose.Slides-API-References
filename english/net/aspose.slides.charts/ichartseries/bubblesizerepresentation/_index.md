## IChartSeries.BubbleSizeRepresentation property

Specifies how the bubble size values are represented on the bubble chart. This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use ParentSeriesGroup.BubbleSizeRepresentation read/write property for change value.

```csharp
public BubbleSizeRepresentationType BubbleSizeRepresentation { get; }
```

## Remarks

This is the projection of the property ParentSeriesGroup.BubbleSizeRepresentation.
