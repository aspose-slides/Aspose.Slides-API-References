## MathBox.Differential property

Differential When true, the box acts as a differential (e.g., 𝑑𝑥 in an integrand), and receives the appropriate horizontal spacing for the mathematical differential. Default: false

```csharp
public bool Differential { get; set; }
```

### Examples

Example:

```csharp
[C#]
IMathBox differential = new MathematicalText("dx").ToBox();
differential.Differential = true;
IMathBlock baseArg = new MathematicalText("x").Join(differential);
IMathNaryOperator integral = baseArg.Integral(MathIntegralTypes.Simple, "0", "1");
```
