## MathElementBase.ToBox method

Places this element in a non-visual box (logical grouping) which is used to group components of an equation or other instance of mathematical text. A boxed object can (for example) serve as an operator emulator with or without an alignment point, serve as a line break point, or be grouped such as not to allow line breaks within.

```csharp
public IMathBox ToBox()
```

### Return Value

Logical box with this element placed inside

### Examples

Example:

```csharp
[C#]
IMathBox box = new MathematicalText("x:=y").ToBox();
```
