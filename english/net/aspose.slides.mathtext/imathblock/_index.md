## IMathBlock interface

Specifies an instance of mathematical text that contained within a MathParagraph and starts on its own line. All math zones, including equations, expressions, arrays of equations or expressions, and formulas are represented by math block.

```csharp
public interface IMathBlock : IMathElement, IMathElementCollection
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AsIMathElement](../../aspose.slides.mathtext/imathblock/asimathelement) { get; } | Allows to get base IMathElement interface [`IMathElement`](../imathelement) |
| [AsIMathElementCollection](../../aspose.slides.mathtext/imathblock/asimathelementcollection) { get; } | Allows to get base IMathElementCollection interface [`IMathElementCollection`](../imathelementcollection) |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
