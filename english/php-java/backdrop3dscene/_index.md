## Methods

| name | return type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [getAnchorPoint](/php-java/backdrop3dscene/getanchorpoint/)() | float | Returns or sets a point in 3D space. This point is the point in space that anchors the backdrop plane. 3D point represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [getNormalVector](/php-java/backdrop3dscene/getnormalvector/)() | float | Returns or sets a normal vector. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector normal to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [getUpVector](/php-java/backdrop3dscene/getupvector/)() | float | Returns or sets a vector representing up. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector representing up in relation to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [setAnchorPoint](/php-java/backdrop3dscene/setanchorpoint/)(float[]) | void | Returns or sets a point in 3D space. This point is the point in space that anchors the backdrop plane. 3D point represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [setNormalVector](/php-java/backdrop3dscene/setnormalvector/)(float[]) | void | Returns or sets a normal vector. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector normal to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
| [setUpVector](/php-java/backdrop3dscene/setupvector/)(float[]) | void | Returns or sets a vector representing up. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector representing up in relation to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates. Read/write float[]. |
