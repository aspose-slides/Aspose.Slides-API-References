## getBestImagesCompressionRatio() method

 Indicates if the most effective compression (instead of the default one) for each image must be selected 
 automatically. If set to true, for every image in presentation the most appropriate compression
 algorithm will be chosen, what will lead to the smaller size of the resulting PDF document. 
 Best image compression ratio selection is computationally expensive and takes 
 an additional amount of RAM, and this option is false by default.
 Default is false.
