## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [getAngle](getangle)() | Describes the relative angle of the motion path. Read/write float. |
| [getBy](getby)() | Describes the relative offset value for the animation (in percents). Read/write java.awt.geom.Point2D.Float. |
| [getFrom](getfrom)() | Specifies an x/y co-ordinate to start the animation from (in percents). Read/write java.awt.geom.Point2D.Float. |
| [getOrigin](getorigin)() | Specifies what the origin of the motion path is relative to such as the layout of the slide, or the parent. Read/write MotionOriginType. |
| [getPath](getpath)() | Specifies the path primitive followed by coordinates for the animation motion. Read/write IMotionPath. |
| [getPathEditMode](getpatheditmode)() | Specifies how the motion path moves when shape is moved. Read/write MotionPathEditMode. |
| [getRotationCenter](getrotationcenter)() | Describes the center of the rotation used to rotate a motion path by X angle. Read/write java.awt.geom.Point2D.Float. |
| [getTo](getto)() | Specifies the target location for an animation motion effect (in percents). Read/write java.awt.geom.Point2D.Float. |
| [setAngle](setangle)(float) | Describes the relative angle of the motion path. Read/write float. |
