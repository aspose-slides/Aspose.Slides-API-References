## setDisableLineEndCropping(boolean value)  method

 SVG 1.1 lacks ability to define insets for markers.
 Aspose.Slides SVG writing engine has workaround for that problem:
 it crops end of line with arrow, so, line doesn't overlap markers.
 This option switches off such behavior.
 Read/write  boolean.
 

### Returns
boolean
