# Timing class

 Represents animation timing.
 

## Methods

| name | return type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [getAccelerate](/slides/php-java/timing/getaccelerate/)() | float | Describes the percentage of duration accelerate behavior effect. Read/write float. |
| [getAutoReverse](/slides/php-java/timing/getautoreverse/)() | boolean | Describes whether to automatically play the animation in reverse after playing it in the forward direction. Read/write boolean. |
| [getDecelerate](/slides/php-java/timing/getdecelerate/)() | float | Describes the percentage of duration decelerate behavior effect. Read/write float. |
| [getDuration](/slides/php-java/timing/getduration/)() | float | Describes the duration of animation effect. Read/write float. |
| [getRepeatCount](/slides/php-java/timing/getrepeatcount/)() | float | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write float. |
| [getRepeatDuration](/slides/php-java/timing/getrepeatduration/)() | float | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write float. |
| [getRestart](/slides/php-java/timing/getrestart/)() | int | Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete. Read/write EffectRestartType. |
| [getSpeed](/slides/php-java/timing/getspeed/)() | float | Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing. Read/write float. |
| [getTriggerDelayTime](/slides/php-java/timing/gettriggerdelaytime/)() | float | Describes delay time after trigger. Read/write float. |
| [getTriggerType](/slides/php-java/timing/gettriggertype/)() | int | Describes trigger type. Read/write EffectTriggerType. |

| [setRepeatDuration](/slides/php-java/timing/setrepeatduration/)(float) | void | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write float. |
| [setRestart](/slides/php-java/timing/setrestart/)(int) | void | Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete. Read/write EffectRestartType. |
| [setSpeed](/slides/php-java/timing/setspeed/)(float) | void | Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing. Read/write float. |
| [setTriggerDelayTime](/slides/php-java/timing/settriggerdelaytime/)(float) | void | Describes delay time after trigger. Read/write float. |
| [setTriggerType](/slides/php-java/timing/settriggertype/)(int) | void | Describes trigger type. Read/write EffectTriggerType. |
