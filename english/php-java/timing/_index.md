## Timing class

 Represents animation timing.
 

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [getAccelerate](getaccelerate)() | Describes the percentage of duration accelerate behavior effect. Read/write float. |
| [getAutoReverse](getautoreverse)() | Describes whether to automatically play the animation in reverse after playing it in the forward direction. Read/write boolean. |
| [getDecelerate](getdecelerate)() | Describes the percentage of duration decelerate behavior effect. Read/write float. |
| [getDuration](getduration)() | Describes the duration of animation effect. Read/write float. |
| [getRepeatCount](getrepeatcount)() | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write float. |
| [getRepeatDuration](getrepeatduration)() | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write float. |
| [getRestart](getrestart)() | Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete. Read/write EffectRestartType. |
| [getSpeed](getspeed)() | Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing. Read/write float. |
| [getTriggerDelayTime](gettriggerdelaytime)() | Describes delay time after trigger. Read/write float. |
| [getTriggerType](gettriggertype)() | Describes trigger type. Read/write EffectTriggerType. |
| [setAccelerate](setaccelerate)(float) | Describes the percentage of duration accelerate behavior effect. Read/write float. |
| [setAutoReverse](setautoreverse)(boolean) | Describes whether to automatically play the animation in reverse after playing it in the forward direction. Read/write boolean. |
| [setDecelerate](setdecelerate)(float) | Describes the percentage of duration decelerate behavior effect. Read/write float. |
| [setDuration](setduration)(float) | Describes the duration of animation effect. Read/write float. |
| [setRepeatCount](setrepeatcount)(float) | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write float. |
| [setRepeatDuration](setrepeatduration)(float) | Describes the number of times the effect should repeat. Read/write float. |
| [setRestart](setrestart)(int) | Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete. Read/write EffectRestartType. |
| [setSpeed](setspeed)(float) | Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing. Read/write float. |
