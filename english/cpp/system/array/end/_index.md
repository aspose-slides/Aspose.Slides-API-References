## Array::end() method


Returns an iterator to the element following the last element of the container. This element acts as a placeholder; attempting to access it results in undefined behavior.

```cpp
iterator System::Array<T>::end() noexcept
```


### Return Value

An iterator pointing to the theoretical element placed after the last element of the container.

## Array::end() const method


Returns an iterator to the element following the last element of the const-qualified container. This element acts as a placeholder; attempting to access it results in undefined behavior.

```cpp
const_iterator System::Array<T>::end() const noexcept
```


### Return Value

An iterator pointing to the theoretical element placed after the last element of the const-qualified container.
