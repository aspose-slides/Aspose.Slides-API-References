## IStreamWrapper::Write(System::ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>, int32_t, int32_t) method


writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written.

```cpp
virtual void Aspose::Slides::IStreamWrapper::Write(System::ArrayPtr<uint8_t> buffer, int32_t offset, int32_t count)=0
```


### Arguments

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buffer | [System::ArrayPtr](../../../system/arrayptr/)\<**uint8_t**\> | An array of bytes **uint8_t**[] |
| offset | **int32_t** | The zero-based byte offset in buffer at which to begin copying bytes to the current stream **int32_t** |
| count | **int32_t** | The number of bytes to be written to the current stream **int32_t** |
