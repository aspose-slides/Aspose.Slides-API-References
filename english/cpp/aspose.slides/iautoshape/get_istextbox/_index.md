## IAutoShape::get_IsTextBox() method


Specifies if the shape is a text box.

```cpp
virtual bool Aspose::Slides::IAutoShape::get_IsTextBox()=0
```

## Remarks


If shape is not specified to be a text box does not mean that it cannot have text attached to it. A text box is merely a specialized shape with specific properties.
