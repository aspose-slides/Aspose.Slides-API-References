```cpp
enum class MathSpacingRules
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SingleSpacingGap | 0 | Single (1 em for columns or 1 line for rows) |
| OneAndHalfSpacingGap | 1 | One and a half (1.5 ems for columns or 1.5 lines for rows) |
| DoubleSpacingGap | 2 | Double spacing (2 ems for columns or 2 lines for rows) |
| Exactly | 3 | Exactly value For columns, rely on value of ColumnGap, measured in twips For rows, rely on value of RowGap, measured in twips |
| Multiple | 4 | Multiple For columns, rely on value of ColumnGap, measured in 0.5 em increments For rows, rely on value of RowGap, measured in lines |
