## PdfOptions::set_BestImagesCompressionRatio(bool) method


Indicates if the most effective compression (instead of the default one) for each image must be selected automatically. If set to **bool**.true, for every image in presentation the most appropriate compression algorithm will be chosen, what will lead to the smaller size of the resulting PDF document.

```cpp
void Aspose::Slides::Export::PdfOptions::set_BestImagesCompressionRatio(bool value) override
```

## Remarks


Best image compression ratio selection is computationally expensive and takes an additional amount of RAM, and this option is **bool**.false by default.

Default is **bool**.false.
