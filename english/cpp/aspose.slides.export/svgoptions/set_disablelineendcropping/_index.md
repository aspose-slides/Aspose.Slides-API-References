## SVGOptions::set_DisableLineEndCropping(bool) method


SVG 1.1 lacks ability to define insets for markers. [Aspose.Slides](../../../aspose.slides/) SVG writing engine has workaround for that problem: it crops end of line with arrow, so, line doesn't overlap markers. This option switches off such behavior. Write **bool**.

```cpp
void Aspose::Slides::Export::SVGOptions::set_DisableLineEndCropping(bool value) override
```
