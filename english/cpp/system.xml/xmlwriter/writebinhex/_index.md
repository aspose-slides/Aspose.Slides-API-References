## XmlWriter::WriteBinHex(ArrayPtr\<uint8_t\>, int32_t, int32_t) method


When overridden in a derived class, encodes the specified binary bytes as **BinHex** and writes out the resulting text.

```cpp
virtual void System::Xml::XmlWriter::WriteBinHex(ArrayPtr<uint8_t> buffer, int32_t index, int32_t count)
```

| index | **int32_t** | The position in the buffer indicating the start of the bytes to write. |
| count | **int32_t** | The number of bytes to write. |
