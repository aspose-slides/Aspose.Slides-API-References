## ChartSeries::get_DoughnutHoleSize() method


Specifies the size of the hole in a doughnut chart (can be between 10 and 90 percents of the size of the plot area.). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_DoughnutHoleSize() read/write property for change value. Read-only **uint8_t**.

```cpp
uint8_t Aspose::Slides::Charts::ChartSeries::get_DoughnutHoleSize() override
```

## Remarks


This is the projection of the property [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_DoughnutHoleSize().
