## ChartSeries::get_Overlap() method


Specifies how much bars and columns shall overlap on 2-D charts (from -100 to 100). This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_Overlap() read/write property for change value. Read-only **int8_t**.

```cpp
int8_t Aspose::Slides::Charts::ChartSeries::get_Overlap() override
```

## Remarks


This is the projection of the property [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_Overlap().
