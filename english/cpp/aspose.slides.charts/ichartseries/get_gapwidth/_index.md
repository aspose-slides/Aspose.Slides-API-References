## IChartSeries::get_GapWidth() method


Specifies the space between bar or column clusters, as a percentage of the bar or column width. This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_GapWidth() read/write property for change value. Read-only **int32_t**.

```cpp
virtual int32_t Aspose::Slides::Charts::IChartSeries::get_GapWidth()=0
```

## Remarks


This is the projection of the property [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_GapWidth().
