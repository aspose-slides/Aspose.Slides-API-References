## IChartSeries::get_IsColorVaried() method


Specifies that each data marker in the series has a different color. This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_IsColorVaried() read/write property for change value. Read-only **bool**.

```cpp
virtual bool Aspose::Slides::Charts::IChartSeries::get_IsColorVaried()=0
```

## Remarks


This is the projection of the property [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_IsColorVaried().
