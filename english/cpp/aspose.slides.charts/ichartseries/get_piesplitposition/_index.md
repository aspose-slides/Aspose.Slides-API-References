## IChartSeries::get_PieSplitPosition() method


Specifies a value that shall be used to determine which data points are in the second pie or bar on a pie-of-pie or bar-of-pie chart. Is used together with PieSplitBy property. This is the property not only of this series but of all series of parent series group - this is projection of appropriate group property. And so this property is read-only. Use ParentSeriesGroup property for access to parent series group. Use [get_ParentSeriesGroup()](../get_parentseriesgroup/)->get(set)_PieSplitPosition() read/write property for change value. Read-only **double**.

```cpp
virtual double Aspose::Slides::Charts::IChartSeries::get_PieSplitPosition()=0
```

## Remarks
